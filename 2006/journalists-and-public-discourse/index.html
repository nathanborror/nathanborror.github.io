<h1>Journalists and public discourse</h1>

<p>I was involved in a discussion recently about whether journalists should be
allowed to comment on news stories. My employer, the Lawrence Journal-World,
allows the public to comment on online stories. Quick note: while I may work for
the newspaper my experience with journalism at the time of this post is very
informal. I am a member of the public, which in my opinion makes this opinion
just as valid as any.</p>
<p>Journalists have an obligation to participate in the public discourse so long as
they adhere to the principles of journalistic (<a href=http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles>http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles</a>)
integrity. The delivery of news over an interactive medium allows for a closer
relationship between a journalist and their audience. Why should a journalist
end a story at the last sentence? Journalists sort through a variety of data to
form their story which makes their participation essential in discussing or
correcting the presented, edited data.</p>
<p>Journalism&rsquo;s purpose is to strengthen communities. Journalist forum
participation not only enhances a story, it bridges the perceived gap between
journalist and reader. I would even bet that over time it would increase
participation and readership.</p>
