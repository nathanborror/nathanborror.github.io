<p>Your heart starts pounding, blood pressure soars and you begin to take shorter
faster breaths. Why do we put every cell in our body through such a traumatic
experience?</p>
<p>Stress was hard wired into our bodies for those face to face moments with
mountain lions. It&rsquo;s called fight or flight. Mountain lions don&rsquo;t seem to bother
us anymore so we&rsquo;ve repurposed this reaction to things like client deadlines,
idiots on the freeway, and that bar that plays horrible music on wednesday
nights below my loft. I&rsquo;ve decided for myself this is unacceptable so here is
what I&rsquo;m doing to combat this ridiculous instinct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise: Clears my head and makes me a lot happier the following day.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t Pass the Buck: Some might think this causes more stress but in my
experience it doesn&rsquo;t. Suck it up and move on.</li>
<li>Make Task Lists: This gets the stuff you try to remember off your mind so you
can make room for other things.</li>
<li>Check Off Tasks: For every three tasks I write down I try to immediately
complete one of them. This inevitably leads to checking off more.</li>
<li>Get It Done: When it&rsquo;s done it&rsquo;s off your plate and out of your mind.</li>
<li>Controlled Breathing: This may sound weird but if you control the speed at
which you breath in and out it has enormous calming effects on the body.</li>
<li>Stretching: Certain stretches can make you feel more introverted or extroverted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stress is very counter productive and we need to be more aware of how stupid it is.</p>
