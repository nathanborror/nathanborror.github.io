<p>Context can be described as, &ldquo;the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed.&rdquo; Context plays an important role in communication and I&rsquo;d like start by providing better context to posts.</p>
<p>You may have noticed a left column on my blog post pages. It now contains geo location information regarding where the post was written, categories it belongs to, links that exist within the post and photos that were taken on the day the it was published.</p>
<h3 id=what-does-all-this-mean>What does all this mean?</h3>
<p>The goal is to give posts an added level of meaning. In some instances I&rsquo;ve noticed a correlation between <a href=https://nathan.run/2006/its-time-to-behave>photos</a> and what I decided to write or maybe a <a href=https://nathan.run/2005/innocent-bystander>location</a> inspired a post. Sometimes it may not be as apparent but, if anything, it brings a little more life to information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on adding photos that correlate to the location pages once I have time to play with the new geo <a href=http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/geotagging_one_.html>data</a> in Flickr. I&rsquo;d love to see other examples of this practice. Suggestions are always welcome.</p>
