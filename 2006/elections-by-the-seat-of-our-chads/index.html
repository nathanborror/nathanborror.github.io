<p>I&rsquo;ve launched a lot of web projects in my career, but none of them have come
close to the excitement of this evenings whirlwind. For the 2006 elections our
little group called World Online at the Lawrence Journal-World launched a live
view of the local and state citizens fulfilling their democratic roles as citizens.</p>
<p>At 7pm CST we flipped the switch, waiting patiently while live data feeds poured
in from Associated Press, Kansas Secretary of State and Douglas County. I&rsquo;ve done
Flash projects before and normally you working with static of semi-dynamic data
but I&rsquo;ve never semi-blindly uploaded files that would soon be feed information
from places I&rsquo;d never seen before and viewed by literally thousands of people
instantaneously. As soon as data poured in changes had to be made, graphics
added, inconsistencies spotted. The rush was amazing.</p>
<p>!http://media.domaki.com/www/election_map.jpg</p>
<p>This map (<a href=http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/state_treasurer/>http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/state_treasurer/</a>)
shows voter turn out and candidate totals across Douglas County in Kansas.
What&rsquo;s amazing is the story data can tell just by being represented in a simple
fashion using basic design principles.</p>
<p>Tonight was a thrill and it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if it wasn&rsquo;t for the
hard work and dedication that our team has towards delivering data to its
audience. I&rsquo;m already excited for 2008!</p>
