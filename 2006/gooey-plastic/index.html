<p>At what point does interactive design become temporal art over plastic art? This
question seems to be rare yet extremely important in our decision making process.
This (<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/</a>) book prompted my pondering
of this.</p>
<p>To clarify, temporal art includes poetry, writing, film and music. Plastic art
takes the form of painting, drawing and sculpture. What sets the two apart is
that fourth dimension, time. The success of temporal art is in its progressive
events leading up to a fulfilling end, better known as climax. This all makes
sense, right? So how do we classify interactive art?</p>
<p>My guess is it&rsquo;s both, however, I&rsquo;m leaning toward temporal. Unfortunately a lot
of times we design with a plastic mindset when we should be thinking about a
climactic ending. Should we be treating sites like small stories? Grab peoples
attention, pull them in, building them up, then smack them with an unforgettable
message. Very few do this. The non-linear aspect of this medium complicates the
time quality of temporal art.</p>
<p>So what is interactive art? Still pondering this one.</p>
