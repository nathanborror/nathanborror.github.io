<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of versioning. And I don&rsquo;t mean versioning in the programming sense, although I really need to figure out <a href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>Subversion</a> one of these days. I&rsquo;m referring to content management systems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but deletion just bugs me. Maybe its my pack rat mentality but to delete is to lose. I write blog entries all the time that don&rsquo;t get published and sometimes I completely rewrite them losing past versions. This seems more important in CMS&rsquo;s where content evolves and sometimes needs to be step back. From what I&rsquo;ve experienced this isn&rsquo;t easy, or even an option in most cases.</p>
<p>Is this a needed feature? <a href=http://www.wiki.org/>Wiki&rsquo;s</a> do a fantastic job of this. <a href=http://www.writeboard.com/>Writeboards</a> by <a href=http://www.37signals.com>37Signals</a> are a great example (love the compare feature). But how often do you see a site managed by a Wiki or a Writeboard? I&rsquo;d like to know your thoughts.</p>
