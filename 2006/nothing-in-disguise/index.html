<p>A few Sunday&rsquo;s back I was in a coffee house determined to work. Instead, I quickly fell into a dream state which is the plague of many Sunday mornings. I felt guilty about being so unproductive, but, I had no pressing deadlines, no urgent emails, no clients knocking at my door. Later that night I felt a surge of creativity and began painting, which got me wondering. Lets see what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555972608/>Brenda Ueland</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our idea that we must always be energetic and active is all wrong. Bernard
Shaw says that it is not true that Napoleon was always snapping out decisions
to a dozen secretaries and aides-de-camp, as we are told, but that he moodled
around for months. Of course he did. And that is why these smart, energetic,
do-it-now, pushing people so often say: &ldquo;I am not creative.&rdquo; They are, but
they should be idle, limp and alone for much of the time, as lazy as men
fishing on a levee, and quietly looking and thinking, not <em>willing</em> all the
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to make time for nothing. It allows you to open your mind to thought you might not normally invite in. In a way, these moments cultivate our creative fields. When it&rsquo;s time to harvest, ideas should be ripe for the pickings. Basically, the answers we arrive at are a result of past thought. Neglect these moments and you limit the quality of creative outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some 40 thousand (and counting) elementary schools have eliminated recess in favor of more time for academics,&rdquo; says <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738210536/>David Elkind</a>. This is shocking. From what I recall, recess was the most rejuvenating part of my elementary day. &ldquo;Our schools are now contributing to the suppression of curiosity, imagination and fantasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we get older we unknowingly loose touch with our creative side and our imagination. I remember looking at clouds and immediately spotting frogs, space ships or elephants. Now I have to concentrate to come up with anything. Making time for relaxing and dreaming is so important, if for no other reason than to look up and see a giraffe float by.</p>
