<p>You may have noticed a little downtime Sunday evening. I was able to get the code under <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>version control</a> which I highly recommend. It allows you to kick FTP to the curb and do everything with &ldquo;svn commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; commands.</p>
<p>The main reason for doing this was my extreme inability to remember which files I&rsquo;ve changed. <a href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>Subversion</a> takes the worry out of my day by committing the necessary files from my local machine to my repository. I can then update my live site copy with a simple update command. My setup is pretty simple. My repository is on Dreamhost. I have have a local copy checked out on my laptop where I make my changes. I have another copy checked out on Dreamhost thats served up fresh to you. I commit changes via my local terminal and ssh to my live directory on Dreamhost to update the code to the latest version. Pretty simple!</p>
<p><a href=http://trac.edgewall.org/>Trac</a> is also handy for navigating the repository online but acts more as a project management tool. Anytime I come across a bug or a UI enhancement I can open a ticket to Trac which can be closed upon
completion. It can also review and compare changes of any file if you ever have to roll a file back to an older version.</p>
<p><a href=http://macromates.com/>Textmate</a> has some handy Subversion key commands but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fully explore them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Django or Python make sure you edit your config file under your hidden .subversion directory to exclude .pyc files. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be making a ton of unnecessary file updates.</p>
