<p>I said Friday but I meant Monday. Sometimes things take longer but in my case I just wanted to compete for attention the same day <a href=http://www.digg.com>Digg 3</a> launched. All amusement aside I&rsquo;d like to take the plastic wrap off my new site that I&rsquo;ve dubbed 80x80.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming and I&rsquo;ve finally got something I&rsquo;m proud of. She&rsquo;s still stretching herself out so if you notice any kinks let me know and I&rsquo;ll call the masseuse. You&rsquo;ll see the <a href=https://nathan.run/tools>Lab</a> grow soon into a dumping ground for prototypes and ideas. To keep things lively the artwork above will change as frequently as possible. You may notice the death of my tags, sorry, I opted for a clear set of categories. <a href=https://nathan.run/work>Portfolio</a> is simple and should provide a glimpse of my contributions. <a href=https://nathan.run/work>Resume</a> is, well, a resume.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;d like to say a few words on the nuts and bolts. I&rsquo;ve parted ways with <a href=http://www.rubyonrails.com>Rails</a>. I enjoy Ruby immensely, it&rsquo;s a beautiful language and I highly recommend it for those of you building web apps. However, while I wear many hats, none of them include web app developer. My largest hat is information designer. I spoon feed content to people in a stimulating fashion in hopes of planting a brand seed in their brain, thats all. After a few weeks of tinkering around I realized <a href=http://www.djangoproject.com>Django</a> was my new muse. In less than a weekend I had a prototype for this site which allowed me to focus directly on usability, design and content while eliminating time towards an admin tool. Ruby on Rails made programming fun again but Django liberated me from back-end development.</p>
<p>I would like to give a big thanks to <a href=http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/jun/06/lost-theories-with-source-code/>Jeff Croft</a>, <a href=http://www.wilsonminer.com/posts/2006/may/10/are-you-generic/>Wilson Miner</a>, and those that maintain <a href=http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/faq/#who-s-behind-this>Django</a> for their glowing examples clear documentation. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more there are a couple great videos by <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2939556954580527226&q=snakes+and+rubies">Adrian</a> and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-70449010942275062&q=django">Jacob</a> on Google. Thats all for now. I&rsquo;m excited and I hope everyone else is too.</p>
