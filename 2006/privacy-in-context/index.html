<p>In the 20&rsquo;s we fought prohibition, 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s it was segregation. Today we
face a new battle called privacy. I bring this up because in todays Lawrence
Journal-World Sarah Benson wrote an interesting article titled Facebook
indiscretions plague users (<a href=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/)>http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/)</a>.</p>
<p>In her article she gives two examples of the unintended consequences of social
networking. The first outlines how an employer can peer into prospective
employees social pasts using current employee accounts. The second explains how
a group of students, toasting to the university alcohol policy in the comforts
of their dorm, got caught by university officials discovering photos in a users
profile.</p>
<p>This is somewhat frightening in a Flickr, MySpace, Friendster, Facebook, Google,
Del.icio.us world. With ease I can pick a person discover last nights party pics,
a detailed description of what movies, music, and body type they are, what
searches they performed last night and what websites they felt worthy of
remembering. This may seem harmless but when aggregated, opinions form, and
worse yet form out of context.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem sharing my photos (<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/)>http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/)</a>,
bookmarks (<a href=http://del.icio.us/sketch22/)>http://del.icio.us/sketch22/)</a>, and even precious thoughts
(<a href=http://www.youknowwhereyouare.com/posts/)>http://www.youknowwhereyouare.com/posts/)</a>. I do worry that those who don&rsquo;t know
me well may take them out of context. While privacy is societies hurdle in the
coming years I think we as individuals need to be reminded of the importance of
context.</p>
