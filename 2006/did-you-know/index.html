<p>I work with a small team of designers inside a very large ad agency
(<a href=http://www.bernstein-rein.com>http://www.bernstein-rein.com</a>). Like most ad agencies they focus primarily on
print and broadcast. Having a small web division can sometimes cause confusion
between the different mediums.</p>
<p>I never really realized how different web was from print and broadcast until my
time at an agency. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a quick list of a few items that I think set
web apart. I could go into more detail but for the sake of brevity I kept them
general and to the point.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Font Families</strong> When setting copy we&rsquo;re limited to a handful of fonts that
natively exist on peoples computers. This means your Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro
W6 is out of the question.</li>
<li><strong>Typography</strong> Unfortunately type sucks on the web but it&rsquo;s getting better.
We use a programming language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define
the properties of typography. CSS has its advantages and limitations. These
limitations include no kerning and no word spacing. Sad but true.</li>
<li><strong>Programming</strong> To make that graphic fly across the screen requires an
understanding of math, physics and logic. In one way or another this holds
true for everything you see on the web. Code is the underlying support beams,
rivets, and concrete. It&rsquo;s the dirty part of the job that no one wants to
witness. More time goes into programming than any part of the job.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> Imagine testing a new car design on 7 different types of roads.
Some roads are too thin, some are comfortably wide, some with speed bumps and
some that defy the laws of nature. This is similar to making sure a website
works in different browsers. This can be the most frustrating phase.</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong> Web is more similar to product design than any other type of
design. If you&rsquo;re going to design a toaster you better be damn sure someone
knows where to put the toast. Easier said than done. This is where a majority
of web design fails. Art is for the wall, design provides solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Impermanent</strong> The web is a living thing. There is no such thing as a
permanent website. If you&rsquo;re waiting for perfection, stop, you won&rsquo;t find it.
If you go live with a design and you find a mistake, fix it. It&rsquo;s not like
finding a mistake after printing 50,000 copies.</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong> If your site doesn&rsquo;t change frequently people won&rsquo;t come back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> If you build it, they will NOT come. It&rsquo;s like building a store
in the middle of Kansas and expecting everyone to know about it. Bullshit!
Banners, search engine placement, word of mouth, and a good product will
bring you the audience you so desire.</li>
<li><strong>Copy</strong> People don&rsquo;t like reading while starring into a huge light bulb. The
message should be short, clear, and memorable. Much like the broadcast medium.
Only the die hards and those that don&rsquo;t suffer from ADD will read.</li>
<li><strong>72dpi</strong> No more no less. Deal with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry if this seems to be preaching to the choir but I felt the need to get this
out in the open.</p>
