I suggest following it if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in an in-depth tutorial. What follows is a more concise version of that article and instead of using PHP I&amp;rsquo;m using a variant of Jacky Tsoi&amp;rsquo;s Python script. This is pretty tedious and there are a lot of steps you have to get right in order for this to work properly so hang in there.</description></item><item><title>Sending Multipart Forms with Objective-C</title><link>https://nathan.run/2012/sending-multipart-forms-with-objective-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2012 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/2012/sending-multipart-forms-with-objective-c/</guid><description>It took me a few evenings to figure this out so I&amp;rsquo;m writing a quick explanation based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve found to work. My use-case is pretty simple, I want to POST some data to a form on a server from an iOS app I&amp;rsquo;m building. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using NSURLRequest to build the request object and NSURLConnection to make the actual connection to the server.
The first thing we need to understand is how Multipart Form requests should be structured.</description></item></channel></rss>
