This was my first personal project to go into the App Store.</description></item><item><title>Play</title><link>https://nathan.run/tools/play/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:31:04 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/tools/play/</guid><description>How I built a Sonos replacement app in 2014 Back in 2014 in my spare time I built an app to replace the default Sonos app used to control multiple speakers in a home. It was a little challenging so I thought Iâ€™d share the process. You can check out most of the code on Github.
Finding the API First off I needed to understand how the existing app was communicating with speakers on the local network.</description></item><item><title>Podster</title><link>https://nathan.run/tools/podster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:31:04 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/tools/podster/</guid><description>My attempt at a very simple client-side RSS parser for podcasts after so much frustration with Apple&amp;rsquo;s Podcast app. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been working on this as much lately since Apple seems to have made some major strides but I still think I can get this to be faster using Go for all the feed fetching.</description></item><item><title>Readernaut</title><link>https://nathan.run/tools/readernaut/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:31:04 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/tools/readernaut/</guid><description>Readernaut is a social network for people who want to share what they&amp;rsquo;re reading. This has been a passion project since 2008. Register for a free account.
Currently working on an update that resurrects the activity feed and makes it a little more visually appealing.
Work in progress.</description></item><item><title>Steady</title><link>https://nathan.run/tools/steady/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:31:04 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/tools/steady/</guid><description>Steady is an experimental tool for tracking personal routines. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to come up with ways to incentivize and track more steady routines. Having a visualization that kind of encourages a streak seems to help me. Sorta stole this idea from Strava when I realized how much I tried to fill out their daily bar graph.
Current overall look of the app. Currently testing but should have something in the App Store this Spring 2021.</description></item></channel></rss>
