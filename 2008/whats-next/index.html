<p>Does it make sense to reinvent the wheel every time we start a new project? No. My work echoes my past and I stand by it. Some say, &ldquo;that looks like Readernaut&rdquo; or &ldquo;that looks like Playground Blues&rdquo; and I say yes, they are me.</p>
<p>If it worked there it will work here. When a problem is solved I move on because each project has its fair amount of new problems and I&rsquo;d rather spend time on new, more interesting problems. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t improve on past solutions. Everything evolves.</p>
<p>We all bring our individual design style and solutions to the table. Projects are a collection of problems and if you quickly eliminate the solved problems you can dig your heals into the unsolved.</p>
