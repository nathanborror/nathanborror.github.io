Of course, solving the intelligence bit is really hard but the way we experience this future is where we‚Äôre gonna need to decide what type of world we want to live in. I personally don‚Äôt want to spend longer than 10 minutes in something the size of a Smart car. And why cars?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy commute is about 45 minutes from Palo Alto to San Francisco. It‚Äôs usually fine, I get to listen to audio-books and read or work when I take the train. How could this be improved? I‚Äôve always wanted an \u003ca href=\"http://www.airstream.com/travel-trailers/sport/\"\u003eAirstream Sport\u003c/a\u003e but the thought of hauling it around and only getting to use it parked seems lame. However, a self-driving Airstream would be sick! I could spend my time much like I spend it at home. Make breakfast, have coffee, read and maybe even get a little work done. All from 130 square feet of comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy stop there? I‚Äôm not married, I don‚Äôt have kids, so why couldn‚Äôt this be home? A home that knows where I need to be and where I like to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery evening would be spent at a new location: in the mountains, on a beach, in a forrest, at my favorite self-driving home neighborhood with my favorite self-driving food trucks nearby. While sleeping the home gently starts taking me to work. I wake up, shower, and have coffee just before arriving. At the end of the day my home arrives after taking care of a few upgrades and another journey awaits. This could spawn whole worlds of destinations catering to a mobile lifestyle. People could personalize their homes and share their favorite drives and destinations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStationary homes would feel so boring! There are so many things to rethink when we take on this vagabond lifestyle. What if your home knew about impending bad weather? How would mail or taxes work?

Each new game plopped you in the middle of nowhere with an axe, a small hut and a goat or pig nearby. You could only see the little parcel of land around you, everything else was pitch black. As you wandered around the world revealed itself. Move east and you‚Äôd discover a forest, move west and you‚Äôd stumble on some gold or more pigs (is there a difference?), move far enough south and you might discover an enemy empire, one you weren‚Äôt prepared for. This is how the game went‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähours of constant struggle balancing exploration with empire building. You had to both know what was out there and be prepared to face it when it came to your little hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exist in a pretty weird time when you think about it. It‚Äôs impossible for some to imagine, but there was a time when the Internet wasn‚Äôt a thing. There was even a time when books weren‚Äôt a thing üòÆ. We actually depended on others to bring us information through their experience and stories. The outside world was largely dark and unknown. We now occupy a world where there are no excuses, everything is exposed. We quickly went from acceptable ignorance to ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you know, are you living under a rock?‚Äù\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upside of all this exposure is we‚Äôre closer to what game theorists call \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information\"\u003ecomplete information.\u003c/a\u003e It‚Äôs when all participants in a game or activity have access to the same knowledge. The trick is making an effort to track it all down. Every problem you face has a dark corner, every skill you possess has a weak understanding, every proposal you‚Äôve made has a flawed point. We all end up accepting varying degrees of unfit aspects of our work and lives. Uncovering these sooner can save money and often personal anguish‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs also rewarding as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html\"\u003eEyes are pretty fascinating\u003c/a\u003e (if you haven‚Äôt seen Neil deGrasse Tyson explain the evolution of the eye in Cosmos I suggest you drop everything). Eyes have two main receptors: cones and rods (some of you probably remember this from high school biology). Rods are more prevalent but they aren‚Äôt responsible for seeing color, that‚Äôs the job of cones. Most of the color sensitive cones are located in a very small patch at the center of the eye. Rods however, are concentrated around the eye and take the lead at providing us with peripheral vision and an ability to see in the dark. They‚Äôre highly tuned to sensing motion, motion that could vary well be a predator trying to eat us. This is evolutions attempt at eliminating a blind spot that‚Äôs the difference between survival and extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish life had the ‚Äúreveal map‚Äù \u003ca href=\"http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/age-of-empires-pc-3020\"\u003echeat code\u003c/a\u003e or the ‚Äúbig daddy‚Äù rocket launching cars but it doesn‚Äôt. While these give you a few hours of your life back and some zeus-like control over ‚Äúthe game‚Äù they also make it really boring. So what are your blind spots? It‚Äôs worth taking a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]}
