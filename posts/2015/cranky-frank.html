  <p><strong>Cranky Frank</strong> — I recently got to watch a private talk by Frank Gehry and I wanted to share a few things:</p>
  <p>First off, he's a no bullshit guy and routinely employs "fuck" to get his point across—it's wonderful to watch. I hope we all get edgier with age.</p>
  <p>Someone asked him a dull question about the software he and his team have been developing over the years, Digital Project (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Project">read more about it</a>). Luckily he took the opportunity to explain why they made it:</p>
  <p>"Contractors rule the industry." Architects poor their souls into a vision and it's trampled by contractors because they ultimately hold all the power. Alright Frank, why? Well the duty of an architect is to formulate all the plans needed to build the vision, then it's the contractors job to execute the plans, but the plans are never perfect. Contractors always find ways to poke holes and drive up costs. He talked about "change orders" which are situations where nothing can proceed because of a conflict like a pipe meeting an unforeseen beam. These change orders are really expensive because workers are sent home and the engineers, architects and owners and put into a room to figure out how to deal with the problem. It's become such a routine that most buildings come with a 25-30% markup due to inevitable change orders which is fucking insane! He was sick of dealing with contractors so he and his team figured out how to eliminate change orders and lower costs by the same markup rate. The software does a much better job identifying unfit decisions and eliminates them before they become costly situations. It also allows him to be more expressive with his designs and build whatever he envisions while even undercutting other architecture firms.</p>
  <p>Amazing and—dare I say—somewhat familiar ;)</p>
  <p>You see this in software a lot. The main difference is we don't lose gobs of money when a "change order" arises. We just lose a little dignity when what we thought was possible isn't and ship dates get pushed. The biggest takeaway for me here was the importance of putting forward the most complete picture possible to engineers. Anticipating as many pipes headed for beams as possible so our vision stays in tact. The most sure way to achieve this is through prototyping or very comprehensive wireframes and mocks.</p>
  <p>Gehry rambled a bit more and said something else, "most architects have become infantile" due to the beating down by contractors over time. They don't take risks and they don't try new things. They stay safe to appease the process. :o Wow, think about that... then get back to work :)</p>
