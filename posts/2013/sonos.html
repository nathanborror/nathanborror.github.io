# Making Sonos Better

For those of you who don’t know, Sonos is a pretty sweet home stereo system with wireless speakers you can place in any room. I live in a pretty small apartment and have a Sonos Amp in my living room, a small speaker in my kitchen and a small speaker in my bedroom. The hardware is great but the software is pretty bad which is sad because you end up interacting with the softare more than the actual hardware.

I don’t endure bad software very long before attempting to redesign it. Thankfully, Sonos is pretty hackable. Google “sonos hacking” and you’ll be on your way. I’m not going to get into how I made the following improvements, you can read and contribute to the code here. So without further ado, here are two optimizations that have improved the effectivness of Sonos based on my own usage patterns (I’m going to assume I’m not alone here but I guess we’ll find out).

## 1: Better Speaker Management

Since I live alone, I’m rarely listing to different music on different speakers. I’m usually trying to get one or more speakers playing the same audio stream (doesn’t mean this solution wouldn’t scale to other streams, just not solving for that right now). I needed something up-front and simple. Below on the left expresses the current steps to chain my kitchen speaker to my living room speaker.

## 2: Better Volume Sliders

I can’t stand Apple’s default UISlider controls. They don’t let you tap anywhere and slide the knob which is how almost every volume interaction works. It’s almost as bad as having an up and down button for adjusting volume. It’s even more annoying when you have to manage more than one like you do with Sonos.
