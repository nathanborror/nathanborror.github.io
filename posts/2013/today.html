<p><strong>Today</strong> — I've never been fond of arbitrary markers in time. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, they all seem odd to me and I've never been one to celebrate them. Every day should be special and accomplishments, small and large should be relished, not random days.</p>
<p>As you would correctly suspect I don't do resolutions. But I do think constantly about a question Buckminster Fuller used to ask his grandson, "What is the most important thing we could be thinking about today?"</p>
