<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/its-time-to-behave/>It's Time To Behave</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, July 10, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>We are all hypocrites, every damn one of us. Well, actually, just those that are guilty of inline javascript. Now don&rsquo;t get all puffed up, I&rsquo;m just as guilty but it&rsquo;s time to change and I have some tips!
Over the past couple years we&rsquo;ve heard a lot about separation. Two types, in particular, have been evangelized, data from structure and structure from style. One we don&rsquo;t hear about nor see it practiced very often is separation between structure and behavior.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/seven-patriots/>Seven Patriots</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, July 4, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>What better way to celebrate our independence than roaring into space in one of the most complex machines ever built! You can watch this miraculous display of human engineering at NASA.gov (http://www.nasa.gov/).
Space exploration gives me goose bumps. My heart skips a beat when, just for one second, I try to comprehend its limitless nature. To think we&rsquo;re able to catapult seven of our greatest minds into this vacuum of questions and answers makes me pause and wonder what we&rsquo;ll choose to achieve next.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/django-gotchas/>Django Gotchas</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, June 30, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles in learning any new framework or programming language is learning its quirks. By quirks I don&rsquo;t mean bugs, I&rsquo;m referring to the personality and flow. Here are a few that might help your troubleshooting process:
I get an error when I run syncdb. This could be a number of things. If its an error in the model you should be able to tell. Most of the time for me was forgetting to add the project to the settings.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/80x80/>80x80</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, June 26, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I said Friday but I meant Monday. Sometimes things take longer but in my case I just wanted to compete for attention the same day Digg 3 launched. All amusement aside I&rsquo;d like to take the plastic wrap off my new site that I&rsquo;ve dubbed 80x80.
It&rsquo;s been a long time coming and I&rsquo;ve finally got something I&rsquo;m proud of. She&rsquo;s still stretching herself out so if you notice any kinks let me know and I&rsquo;ll call the masseuse.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/victory-out-of-context/>Victory Out of Context</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, May 27, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>President Bush says, just as the United States persevered and ultimately won the Cold War against communism, America will emerge victorious in the war on terror. &ndash; http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-05-27-voa17.cfm
It&rsquo;s misleading and irresponsible to imply the possibility of victory over terror. It is idealistically impossible to abolish a feeling. People will always fear and at times that fear will escalate to terror. From the time we are born we learn fear, it aids in our survival until the day we die.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/highlights/>Highlights</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, May 6, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;m notorious for highlighting. At home, I&rsquo;m surrounded by a rapidly growing library. Some books have been read cover to cover, some cover to creamy center, and some randomly picked through. But, I can confidently guarantee, each has felt the screeching of my fat yellow Avery HI-LITER.
Why? Maybe it&rsquo;s an incessant urge to mark my territory or a worry that I&rsquo;ll forget a phrase that made my grey matter jiggle.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/subversion-love/>Subversion Love</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, April 30, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I have a new love (http://subversion.tigris.org). For the past year I&rsquo;ve been putting off this slightly important part of being a pragmatic programmer (http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml).
I&rsquo;ve heard the horror stories of CVS so I steered clear of it for this new flavor of life saving loveliness. Gone are the days of, &ldquo;is this the newest copy?&rdquo; Goodbye to unsettling feelings of cautiously dragging and dropping files from one server to the next.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/making-the-case/>Making The Case</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, April 25, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Why is it that certain days I opt for the Man&rsquo;s coffee and other days I champion the locals? I thought it had something to do with consistency but that&rsquo;s bullshit. While the Man&rsquo;s store is well designed and has a familiar atmosphere it reeks of fake smiles, stale business folk, and overly perfect pastries. Admittedly those dainty pastries are quite wonderful, but thats besides the point.
The locals aren&rsquo;t afraid to show attitude, they&rsquo;re real, they proudly bear the title, Barista.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/dont-stress/>Don't Stress</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, April 22, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Your heart starts pounding, blood pressure soars and you begin to take shorter faster breaths. Why do we put every cell in our body through such a traumatic experience?
Stress was hard wired into our bodies for those face to face moments with mountain lions. It&rsquo;s called fight or flight. Mountain lions don&rsquo;t seem to bother us anymore so we&rsquo;ve repurposed this reaction to things like client deadlines, idiots on the freeway, and that bar that plays horrible music on wednesday nights below my loft.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/dont-delete-version/>Don't Delete, Version</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, April 19, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of versioning. And I don&rsquo;t mean versioning in the programming sense, although I really need to figure out Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) one of these days. I&rsquo;m referring to content management systems.
I don&rsquo;t know why but deletion just bugs me. Maybe its my pack rat mentality but to delete is to lose. I write blog entries all the time that don&rsquo;t get published and sometimes I completely rewrite them losing past versions.</p>
