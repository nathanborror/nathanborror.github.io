<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/lukova-exhibition/>Lukova Exhibition</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, May 10, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently Luba Lukova graced our local Art and Design Gallery with some of her current works and sketches. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of her style and philosophy. She currently teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
Her unique style focuses on metaphorical references, manipulation of the human form and she uses a very unique treatment of typography. I was able to snap some photos to share with you.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/quicksilver-revolution/>Quicksilver Revolution</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, May 8, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>As soon as I realized something was flirting with perfection I discover it gets even better. Over the past three years I&rsquo;ve experienced Mac OS X evolve into, in my opinion, the most effective operating system on the planet. This revolution has spawned many enhancing third party applications. After reading the hype about Quicksilver I finally gave it some attention. Seconds after installing my jaw dropped.
I take my laptop everywhere and its my sole computer.</p>

<h4>Thursday, May 6, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been brushing up on my skills as a skateboarder behind a local Italian Restaurant. It began in my friends basement when we found a beat up skateboard during a regular weekend gathering. This sparked our interest further so we ended up buying some generic boards from a local skate shop. They were black underneath and screaming for artwork.
Last weekend we bought some spray paint (hot pink is unbelievably hard to find) and mylar.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/a-modern-experience/>A Modern Experience</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, May 3, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>The Guggenheim in Manhattan recently had an Exhibition entitled &ldquo;Singular Forms (Sometimes Repeated)&rdquo; Art from 1951 to the Present. Not your typical exhibition where you study lavish master works. The topic was Minimalism and, at first, I was somewhat timid; this being my virgin modernist exhibition. I began reading the blocks of text describing each piece while the people next too me stared hopelessly into blank canvases. I was fascinated.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/first-things-first/>First Things First</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, March 19, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been pondering many questions regarding my place as a designer. I feel I may have lost sight of certain goals which have lead me to question my purpose. Design will always be my first love, however, I need to be true to that which I love.
I spent time last night rereading The First Things First Manifesto. I recommend FTF to all designers, for it will stir up the same questions floating around in my head.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kinetic-art/>Kinetic Art</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, March 14, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Over the weekend I&rsquo;ve been preparing for my trip to Manhattan that is taking place next week. I&rsquo;ve been reading up on some new artists and refreshing myself on Art History because it makes the gallery and museum experience much more enjoyable when you have some knowledge behind what your looking at.
I came across one of my favorite artists that always seems to capture my attention. Alexander Calder&rsquo;s mobiles are so fascinating to me and I always seem to stumble upon them in museums.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/indy-support/>Indy Support</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, March 4, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been distancing myself from &ldquo;corporate america.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to completely do unless your Ted Kaczynski but even he had to buy stamps. (Now I&rsquo;m going to get weird Google referrals on Ted Kaczynski). Anyway, I have good reason for choosing this direction.
My family has a history of entrepreneurs that range from a Grandfather that sold &ldquo;Nimrods&rdquo; to a mom that makes and sells women&rsquo;s clothing. This compels me to spend an extra dollar here and there in support of other entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/not-so-lucky/>Not So Lucky</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, February 25, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>In response to my good friend Ryan&rsquo;s entry on iTunes I&rsquo;d just like to say I haven&rsquo;t won a single song with that Pepsi promo. I guess it&rsquo;s just bad luck or I just don&rsquo;t drink enough Pepsi. I bought a Sierra Mist today and thought for sure I&rsquo;d win but instead I was presented with &ldquo;Please try again.&rdquo;
Anyone want a first generation iPod? I&rsquo;m selling it for 50 bucks, 75 with an iTrip.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/lack-of-words/>Lack of Words</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, February 14, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve noticed I&rsquo;ve been pretty lame with my entries lately. Mainly due to work, work and freelance work. Good things are around the corner so bare with me. In the mean time I&rsquo;ve come across some good reads:
If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it? Drop Shadow League Understanding Design </p>
