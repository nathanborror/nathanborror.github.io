<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/making-old-content-new/>Making old content new</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, March 27, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Why does old content have to fade so quickly? Blogs, zines, news articles all suffer from &ldquo;out with the old, in with the new&rdquo; mentality. There is a lot of old content that retains relevancy far beyond its publish date. The problem is, how do we resurrect it?
Simple, stats tracking. Amazon solved this problem a long time ago. They meticulously track peoples browsing and buying habits and offer up recommendations based on trends.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/make-flash-and-javascript-sing/>Make Flash and Javascript Sing</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, March 18, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Yes its true. You can make Javascript and Flash play together! Way back in 2005 the company formerly known as Macromedia threw together a nice little kit to make these two languages play nicely. Here&rsquo;s how.
First we need to secure some crutial files. The first is a SWF called JavaScriptFlashGateway.swf which allows us to setup a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; between our Flash and Javascript. Second, make sure you link up JavaScriptFlashGateway.js. Third, put JavaScriptSerializer.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/not-so-convergent/>Not so convergent</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, March 14, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Talking about &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; is like talking about &ldquo;the war on terror.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re two incredibly broad terms with unforeseeable outcomes. Convergence has been vogue for a while and I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about its usage to describe media convergence. At this years SXSW, for the first time, someone summed up what I&rsquo;ve been trying to understand.
When I think of convergence I do so in terms of the classic media outlets converging with the Internet.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/austin-bound/>Austin bound</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, March 8, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Austin, Texas today to partake in the South by Southwest festivities. The panel linup this year looks scrumptious. Unlike my pal Jeff (http://www2.jeffcroft.com/blog/2007/mar/01/where-find-me-sxsw/), I have no idea what I&rsquo;ll be attending. I will, however, be attending as many evening parties as I can possibly stumble into. I&rsquo;ll definitely be attending the AMODA (http://www.amoda.org/) Digital Showcase, which was fantastic last year, and the Austin On Rails Happy Hour sporting my Django (http://www.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/rating-system-breakdown/>Rating system breakdown</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, March 5, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I wanna discuss rating systems for a bit. From what I gather there are three flavors: a simple &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method, a thumbs up or down, and the scale. Each solutions goal is to find out what people think of your content. This is helpful when trying to understand your audience.
The &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method As simple as it gets. If someone likes a piece of content they simply click a button saying so.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/playground-is-back/>Playground is back</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, February 28, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>With every rendition of my person site I must emphasize that this is a work in progress. With that said, welcome to my new playground. Sorry about the neurotic name changes. I can assure you they are over and I&rsquo;m pretty darn happy with the new digs.
Why redesign? I wanted to return to my roots. I started out as Playground Blues and this is where I belong. I also wanted something with room to grow.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/easing-into-leopard/>Easing into Leopard</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, January 11, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;m a UI geek and the first thing I noticed during the iPhone demo was how fun scrolling seems. With small devices and even regular sized computers a majority of our time is spent scrolling various collections of content. Only a company like Apple can step back, recognize this, and make it fun. This will no doubt engage users, bringing them closer to flow.
Easing has been around a long time.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/a-look-back/>A look back</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, December 31, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Two thousand six was full of spontaneous moments with great friends and coworkers. It also had some noteworthy, personal milestones that I thought I&rsquo;d highlight before the clock strikes twelve.
January / February saw the launch of Authentic Films (http://www.authenticfilms.net). It was my first official jump into the world of Actionscript and thanks to Travis (http://www.podlob.com) the water wasn&rsquo;t that cold.
March / April involved traveling to Austin, Texas where I attended my first SXSW conference (http://flickr.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/rip-print/>RIP Print</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, December 11, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Print is about to die and we better prepare ourselves. I was doing some christmas shopping last week and stumbled into a Sony Style story. I&rsquo;m not a fan of the Sony brand but they do seem to come out with some daring devices. The first thing that struck me was the Sony Reader (http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/).
The Sony Reader is basically a very thin screen that uses E-Ink technology (http://eink.com/) to display text and basic graphics.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/i-dont-like/>I don't like</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, December 2, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve consistently heard various permutations of two phrases, &ldquo;I like&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Throw away, easy phrases. I&rsquo;ve never valued the first and I&rsquo;ve had nothing but contempt for the second.
My professor in college would dock our grades when someone uttered one of these phrases. He believed they were lame and comfortable. If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to say, you didn&rsquo;t really have anything to say.</p>
