<p>The new and improved webcam (http://www.playgroundblues.com/webcam) is BACK! It now allows you to post messages. When you do it attaches the current image and keeps a running archive of past webcam moments. It&rsquo;s quite possible this is a first in web history. Could I be so lucky?
For those of you who were wondering&mldr; Evocam (http://www.evological.com/evocam.html) is being used to FTP images every 30 seconds. Some handy flash work is being used to serve the newest image to my people.</p>

<p>Friends and cohorts keep asking me me to recommend books so in an effort to slightly curb this I&rsquo;ve manifested the list below. Warning: I cannot guarantee I&rsquo;ve finished these books. I have a tendency, possibly fear, of finishing books. I literally get to the last chapter and it sits on my coffee table for weeks. So far, these have been intriguing books to me:

<h4>Saturday, November 5, 2005</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I found some great Ruby code to assist in creating a simplistic search engine for your Rails app. It can be found on the Rails Wiki under TextSearch. I recommend clicking on the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; button at the bottom to copy and paste the code out of the text field because some of the syntax gets lost on the page version. Just don&rsquo;t click save :)
You may want to add &lsquo;%" on either side of the search terms.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>Playground Blues is officially on Rails. Approximately two weeks ago I started chugging along and with this new language. Surprisingly it&rsquo;s been quite welcoming and easy to learn. I only wish it were just as easy to ween clients over to this oasis.
Along with the change of language came some other needed changes. One of them being my move from Textile to Markdown otherwise known as BlueCloth in Rails. Markdown just seemed more natural to the way I type.</p>

<p>I spent last weekend learning Ruby on Rails (http://www.rubyonrails.com) and now I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why the hell it took me so long. My work (http://www.bradv.com) was kind enough to fetch me a copy of Agile Web Development with Rails (http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html) and I&rsquo;ve had a hard time focusing on anything else.
I&rsquo;ve already started porting some of my apps (http://glide.playgroundblues.com) to Rails and its surprisingly elegant and fun. After figuring out associations between database tables I feel well on my way.</p>

<h4>Tuesday, May 31, 2005</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Why would anybody want to pre-order an album off of iTunes? The whole idea of the &ldquo;pre-order&rdquo; is that your John Hancock gets placed on a list of elite few who get first dibs on a product before it sells out. It is virtually impossible for iTunes to sell out of a song, which makes me wonder what yahoo in the war room decided it&rsquo;d be cool to have &ldquo;pre-orders&rdquo; in iTunes.</p>

<p>Since the release of Tiger and particularly Quicktime 7 sporting the new H.264 codec I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if we&rsquo;re glimpsing a bigger picture here. If you haven&rsquo;t checked out the unbelievable quality of H.264 go over to the HD Gallery and witness the days of pixilation disappear.
With this brings some interesting thoughts; does Apple have a roadmap for video on demand? Well, they&rsquo;ve already started doing it with iTunes 4.</p>

<p>This is my last week at my current employer, Look and Feel which would explain my lack of good posts. I can&rsquo;t express how fortunate I am to have spent time with the fine lads of LaF. I will miss them dearly, although, I&rsquo;ll still be living in the neighborhood so I&rsquo;m sure our paths will cross.
My near future rests at a place called Method within Bernstein-Rein. A fortune teller has forcasted very long hours but many laughs and Belgium beer flowing from the hill tops.</p>

<p>Time to chim in on Tiger. Dashboard, Spotlight, Automator, Oh My! I was worried at first, things were slow and hard drive was crankin'. Once Spotlight finished indexing my mess of over six years of files I breathed a sigh of relief.
Apple has posted a handy little Dashboard Programming Guide with all sorts of design guidlines and API info. They have done the same for Automator. This little app can save scary amounts of time.</p>

<p>Ruby buzz has been making its rounds these last few months. I&rsquo;m anxious to use Rails but my ISP nor my employer support it. So I&rsquo;ve been stuck staring at the colorful lollypop from a distance.
Cake may be the solution to my problems, at least until Ruby becomes more widely supported. Cake is a PHP framework based on the Rails design. It&rsquo;s still in its infancy but it looks pretty solid.</p>

<h4>Wednesday, April 13, 2005</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth with my colleagues regarding pre-built admin tools. My position has been the benefits of adopting a framework outweigh any off-the-shelf tool.
What is the difference between a framework and an off-the-shelf system? It&rsquo;s like buying fake plants instead of real ones. off-the-shelf products leave very little wiggle room for growth and are inevitably more than what you need. They also exhibit poor usability, with there shiny plastic leaves and all.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve become a little obsessed with the &ldquo;Broken Window Theory.&rdquo; I was introduced to this theory by Travis and Charlie. Soon after, it began popping into my head at work, home, or while I was coding. Then I started noticing it in books and on the radio.
The theory is normally applied to urban decay and crime, however, it can be applied to almost anything. How did your apartment get so dirty?</p>

<p>Last night two new albums pitched a tent on my &ldquo;oh my god&rdquo; list of music. The Faint &ldquo;Wet From Birth&rdquo; and Tom Waits &ldquo;Real Gone&rdquo; are so unbelievably necessary I don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;re still reading. Go get them!
The Faint marches forward with its sexy themes and lucius lyrics. My uncertainties about how they would top Blank-Wave Arcade were shattered by the first track and continued to crumble through track two until they were disintegrated with &ldquo;Southern Belles in London Sing.</p>

<p>Today is a sad day. I went for a bike ride downtown and in a moment of braveness, tragedy struck. After making a successful jump from a very large curb a sense of accomplishment ended when my pedal clipped the curb halting my bike and catapulting me through the air. The silence that followed seemed to be more painful than my bleeding arm.
Alvin was a good iPod. The first generation of his time.</p>

Currently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General Education pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and so on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is wrong.</p>

<p>Jason Kottke recently released the next incarnation of Kottke.org. I must say, even though visually things are very similar to the previous version, Jason has done an excellent job of perfecting his structure and usability.
Jason&rsquo;s text dominant design reminds us of the power of typography. His subtle choices of font sizes, weights, leading and link color are methodically chosen along with simple dividers to create a harmonious feel. From the looks of things the famous green header has been on the Atkins diet.</p>

<h4>Sunday, June 6, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a connoisseur of documentary film and rarely do I read fiction opposed to non-fiction. Learning about the actions and habits of society, whether opinionated or not, has always intrigued me. It appears documentary film is rising in popularity. Not surprising due to the rise of Reality TV, they fit right in. Documentaries have allowed those with a story and small voice to speak aloud. Unfortunately, unless you live in a big city you may never get a chance to listen.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a bone to pick with design magazines. I used to buy them frequently based on issue topics. I never subscribe, mainly because I don&rsquo;t want to confine myself to one magazine; sounds weird, deal with it. I haven&rsquo;t purchased any new issues in about four months due to the overwhelming amount of advertisements. No-longer can you &ldquo;flip&rdquo; through these magazines without getting stuck on paper company ads or booklets on Adobe.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/stopdesign-critique/>Stopdesign Critique</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, June 6, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I felt like revisiting Douglas Bowman&rsquo;s Stopdesign since my previous critique was premature. Douglas did a fine job on many fronts. The architecture is a three column joy. Strategic attention was given to the front page where a great deal of content is displayed without overloading your eye. The subtle use of color to distinguish a hierarchy makes this possible. As you dig deeper content expands to a two column layout.</p>

<h4>Tuesday, June 1, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering what angle Google planned to take with its new Gmail service, currently in beta form. After some reading it all makes perfect sense. Google will offer 1GB of email space in return for the ability to scan your messages and place ads based on the content. After the excitement of 1GB wears, I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if the trade off is morally right?
Example: I receive an email regarding a relatives grave health problems; to the right ads are displayed regarding funeral homes.</p>

<h4>Wednesday, May 26, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I hope the following designers don&rsquo;t mind my friendly critique (they shouldn&rsquo;t, design is meant to be critiqued).
Douglas Bowman of Stopdesign recently &ldquo;ditched&rdquo; his styles and &ldquo;start[ed] over with a blank slate.&rdquo; I immediately noticed the identity. Very well done. The new mark is reminiscent of the previous, however, this one is fresher and more bold. The type treatment on the logo is quite interesting as well. Playful but doesn&rsquo;t set itself apart from the mark.</p>

<p>This weekend was very rejuvenating. The weather was beautiful and the town was minus over 5,000 college students. Campus was a ghost town, perfect for a little amateur skateboarding. Downtown was pretty desolate as well. Sunny weather invited me to do some outdoor sketching at the square. I drove by my future apartment enough to give my soon-to-be neighbors the impression of a stalker. Added a new Black Tea to my collection called Lapsang Souchong, it smells like campfire.</p>

<h4>Thursday, May 13, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading Studies In Design by Christopher Dresser. The book was initially published in 1875 as an inspirational guide for designers. Dresser was most notable for his contributions to the Victorian era with his intricately designed textiles, furniture and ceramics. The following are passages I felt like sharing.
Decorations, to be satisfying to the educated, must manifest knowledge&mldr; for unless the decoration is done wisely as well as with understanding , it may yet fail to please those who are best able to appreciate good ornament.</p>

<p>Recently Luba Lukova graced our local Art and Design Gallery with some of her current works and sketches. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of her style and philosophy. She currently teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
Her unique style focuses on metaphorical references, manipulation of the human form and she uses a very unique treatment of typography. I was able to snap some photos to share with you.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been brushing up on my skills as a skateboarder behind a local Italian Restaurant. It began in my friends basement when we found a beat up skateboard during a regular weekend gathering. This sparked our interest further so we ended up buying some generic boards from a local skate shop. They were black underneath and screaming for artwork.
Last weekend we bought some spray paint (hot pink is unbelievably hard to find) and mylar.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>The Guggenheim in Manhattan recently had an Exhibition entitled &ldquo;Singular Forms (Sometimes Repeated)&rdquo; Art from 1951 to the Present. Not your typical exhibition where you study lavish master works. The topic was Minimalism and, at first, I was somewhat timid; this being my virgin modernist exhibition. I began reading the blocks of text describing each piece while the people next too me stared hopelessly into blank canvases. I was fascinated.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been pondering many questions regarding my place as a designer. I feel I may have lost sight of certain goals which have lead me to question my purpose. Design will always be my first love, however, I need to be true to that which I love.
I spent time last night rereading The First Things First Manifesto. I recommend FTF to all designers, for it will stir up the same questions floating around in my head.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I&rsquo;ve been preparing for my trip to Manhattan that is taking place next week. I&rsquo;ve been reading up on some new artists and refreshing myself on Art History because it makes the gallery and museum experience much more enjoyable when you have some knowledge behind what your looking at.
I came across one of my favorite artists that always seems to capture my attention. Alexander Calder&rsquo;s mobiles are so fascinating to me and I always seem to stumble upon them in museums.</p>

<p>In my quest to eliminate wires I purchased the Apple Bluetooth Pro Mouse. It&rsquo;s a very charming piece of hardware. I&rsquo;ve already gone through two of the regular Apple Pro mice. I have a tendency of wrapping the cord around the mouse when I&rsquo;m &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; and eventually the wire inside breaks. However they&rsquo;ve been good to me and so far I&rsquo;ve been very pleased with the Bluetooth derivative. I&rsquo;ve noticed when I&rsquo;m transferring large amounts of data over our WiFi at work the mouse becomes really jumpy.</p>

<p>Today I got my first roll of cross-processed negative film produced by my new Lomo. I&rsquo;m pretty impressed. It took me a while to find a place in town that would cross process negative film but a little mom and pop shop pulled through for me.
What is cross processing you ask? Well basically you use the opposite chemicals to develop the film. Normally negative film is processed with C-41 chemicals and slide film is processed with E6.</p>
