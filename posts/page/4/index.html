<h4>Thursday, March 4, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been distancing myself from &ldquo;corporate america.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to completely do unless your Ted Kaczynski but even he had to buy stamps. (Now I&rsquo;m going to get weird Google referrals on Ted Kaczynski). Anyway, I have good reason for choosing this direction.
My family has a history of entrepreneurs that range from a Grandfather that sold &ldquo;Nimrods&rdquo; to a mom that makes and sells women&rsquo;s clothing. This compels me to spend an extra dollar here and there in support of other entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/not-so-lucky/>Not So Lucky</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, February 25, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>In response to my good friend Ryan&rsquo;s entry on iTunes I&rsquo;d just like to say I haven&rsquo;t won a single song with that Pepsi promo. I guess it&rsquo;s just bad luck or I just don&rsquo;t drink enough Pepsi. I bought a Sierra Mist today and thought for sure I&rsquo;d win but instead I was presented with &ldquo;Please try again.&rdquo;
Anyone want a first generation iPod? I&rsquo;m selling it for 50 bucks, 75 with an iTrip.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/lack-of-words/>Lack of Words</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, February 14, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve noticed I&rsquo;ve been pretty lame with my entries lately. Mainly due to work, work and freelance work. Good things are around the corner so bare with me. In the mean time I&rsquo;ve come across some good reads:
If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it? Drop Shadow League Understanding Design </p>

<p>I want to talk about style. What does it really mean? How do you get it? Does it really matter? I mainly just want to further my understanding of style by writing down some thoughts and ideas. Warning! The following is completely opinionated.
What does style mean? It means you&rsquo;ve carved out a niche where you can be easily recognizable. People seek you for your ability to look a particular way.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/wireless-revolution/>Wireless Revolution</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, February 5, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>In my quest to eliminate wires I purchased the Apple Bluetooth Pro Mouse. It&rsquo;s a very charming piece of hardware. I&rsquo;ve already gone through two of the regular Apple Pro mice. I have a tendency of wrapping the cord around the mouse when I&rsquo;m &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; and eventually the wire inside breaks. However they&rsquo;ve been good to me and so far I&rsquo;ve been very pleased with the Bluetooth derivative. I&rsquo;ve noticed when I&rsquo;m transferring large amounts of data over our WiFi at work the mouse becomes really jumpy.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/the-reading-trail/>The Reading Trail</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, February 4, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be finishing up the Da Vinci Code tonight. Once thats over I&rsquo;m going to get back on the learning train. Cutting back on entertainment television, movies and other distractions. Time to get down to business.
I&rsquo;ve decided to sharpen my skills as an Information Architect. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed the organization of large amounts of data and felt like I was pretty good at it. However, I feel there is much more to learn.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/monster/>Monster</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, January 26, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>This weekend I went to see Monster. I saw the preview and sort of knew what I was getting myself into. It wasn&rsquo;t going to be an uplifting movie but I could tell these people had something to say. Some parts were hard to digest and some really made me question how I treat and view other people. It&rsquo;s a movie that needs to be scene with an open mind and heart.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/just-do-it/>Just Do It</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, January 4, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>One of my most influential professors from college would always say, &ldquo;Just do it!&rdquo; in his thick Bosnian accent during sketch critiques. I&rsquo;m not sure whether he was saying it before Nike but recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to &ldquo;just do it.&rdquo;
We all have these lists of things we want to do in life. Things we want to accomplish, practice, learn, experience. We recall the list in our day dreams but loose sight of how easy it is to &ldquo;just do it.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2003/soundtrack-of-life/>Soundtrack of Life</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, December 16, 2003</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>You may find this odd but have you ever consciously listened to a particular CD during a particular time of your life in hopes that the music will in some way encapsulate those memories?
When I was in New York last March I listened to The Postal Service over and over and now every time I listen to that CD I remember walking up and down broadway and roaming around the subways.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2003/cross-processing-film/>Cross-Processing Film</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, November 3, 2003</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Today I got my first roll of cross-processed negative film produced by my new Lomo. I&rsquo;m pretty impressed. It took me a while to find a place in town that would cross process negative film but a little mom and pop shop pulled through for me.
What is cross processing you ask? Well basically you use the opposite chemicals to develop the film. Normally negative film is processed with C-41 chemicals and slide film is processed with E6.</p>
