<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/rip-alvin-ipod/>Rip Alvin iPod</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, September 29, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Today is a sad day. I went for a bike ride downtown and in a moment of braveness, tragedy struck. After making a successful jump from a very large curb a sense of accomplishment ended when my pedal clipped the curb halting my bike and catapulting me through the air. The silence that followed seemed to be more painful than my bleeding arm.
Alvin was a good iPod. The first generation of his time.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/more-adventurous/>More Adventurous</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, September 28, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>About a year ago a friend of mine introduced me to a little world called Rilo Kiley. Her two albums, &ldquo;Execution of All Things&rdquo; and &ldquo;Takeoffs and Landings&rdquo;, bring sunshine to a rainy day and lift you up to a place not often visited through music. Jenny Lewis&rsquo;s voice never seems to grow old. They&rsquo;re songs are so diverse and colorful.
I honestly didn&rsquo;t believe they could top their last two releases.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/jupiter/>Jupiter</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, September 26, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to introduce a new project of mine. It&rsquo;s called Jupiter. Jupiter is a project management solution that began August 1, 2004 after heavy research. Roughly two months of ironing out the database scheme and functionality I&rsquo;m ready to get feedback and suggestions. Keep in mind things are in the beginning stages and this is by no means a finished/polished product.
I was planning to provide a run down of all the bells and whistles but I think I would rather get everyones first impressions and go from there.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/textpattern-blues/>Textpattern Blues</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, September 9, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve slowly been warming up to Textpattern over the past few months. At the spur of the moment I purchased a nice little plot over at Dreamhost and starting some planting. I&rsquo;m about finished tilling the land and beginning to plant some seeds, however, you might stumble across some rocky areas.
On another note, since when did IE6 not support min-width and max-width? Yet another disappointment handed down from the pearly white gates.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/a-revolution-of-education/>A Revolution of Education</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, September 4, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s time for a Education Revolution. While I may not be an expert in learning science I did participate in the Education system for 17 years and continue to work for an University.
Currently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General Education pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and so on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is wrong.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/heads-or-tails/>Heads or Tails</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, September 2, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been somewhat silent lately with a few whispers here and there. The past couple weeks have been very interesting, stressful to say the least. Job, home and personal changes.
After much thought and pondering I accepted a position at Southwest Missouri State University as Multimedia Producer. I bid a humble farewell to Neubix Studios. The gamut of knowledge and wisdom Ryan and I provided each other was priceless. I&rsquo;m grateful to have been apart of their transformation and growth.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/inspirational-journeys/>Inspirational Journeys</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, July 18, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>In 1947 sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski, moved too Thunder Mountain. He constructed a 741 foot staircase to the peak of the Mountain to begin, with his lone jackhammer, possibly the worlds largest sculpture, Crazy Horse. For the next 33 years he chipped away at the mammoth mountain side until his death.
His eye is 12 feet wide, his outstretched arm the length of a subway train. And by the time his horse is finished, we&rsquo;ll all be dead.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/wireless-lack/>Wireless Lack</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, July 4, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Today my coffee house was closed for the holiday. If you could only see the look on my face. It seems to be the only downside to holidays. This didn&rsquo;t detour me from finding a hotspot that provided legally addictive &ldquo;stimulants.&rdquo;
After much driving my choices were narrowed down to Starbucks and Panera. Starbucks uses T-mobile for wifi which costs money so I chose Panera with its free wifi provided by QGO.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/far-from-modest/>Far from Modest</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, July 3, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Has anyone else really listened to the lyrics on the new Modest Mouse album? For lack of better words, they&rsquo;re amazing.
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. Adding their breeze to the summer nights. Outside water like air was great. I didn&rsquo;t know what I had that day. Walk a little farther to another plan. You said that you did, but you didn&rsquo;t understand. — The World At Large</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/kottke-critique/>Kottke Critique</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, June 29, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Jason Kottke recently released the next incarnation of Kottke.org. I must say, even though visually things are very similar to the previous version, Jason has done an excellent job of perfecting his structure and usability.
Jason&rsquo;s text dominant design reminds us of the power of typography. His subtle choices of font sizes, weights, leading and link color are methodically chosen along with simple dividers to create a harmonious feel. From the looks of things the famous green header has been on the Atkins diet.</p>
