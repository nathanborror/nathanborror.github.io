<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/manually-compressing-pngs/>Manually Compressing PNGs</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, September 18, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>With the advent of some very clean hacks to make PNGs work in IE I&rsquo;ve found myself working them into my designs more. Using them has allowed me to achieve some effects that were next to impossible with JPEGs and GIFs. The biggest hurdle in using PNGs is their file size. The export tools in Photoshop tie your hands behind your back, not allowing you to tweak anything that may lead to a more compact file.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/iphone-dead-30-rental/>iPhone dead; $30 rental?</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, August 15, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>This morning I woke up on my own. Normally I hear little crickets chirping around 7am which is my iPhone letting me know it&rsquo;s time to face the coming day. This morning, no crickets. At first I thought maybe the battery was flat, but that&rsquo;s not possible. I charged it the day before and didn&rsquo;t put it through any rigorous usage. So iPhone CPR commences.
First I try a hard restart, holding down the home and on/off button for a few seconds.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/blueprints-are-not-final/>Blueprints are not final</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, August 10, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>So apparently a little framework called Blueprint (http://bjorkoy.com/blueprint) has reared it&rsquo;s head, born from a few stylesheets that look very familiar. I&rsquo;m somewhat conflicted with its release because I don&rsquo;t think it should be used. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s great, but don&rsquo;t use it.
About five or so months ago I was working on the Journal-World (http://www.ljworld.com) redesign. News sites tend to be very column heavy and I was getting tired of writing the same code over and over to accommodate for my design iterations.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/first-impressions/>First impressions</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, July 1, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>How does a machine have soul? We could try and answer by throwing around terms like usefulness, elegance and grace but all our attempts would sound prosaic next to the device I recently became acquainted with. Run and hide Crackberry, the iPhone is here.
For people to be drooling over a 4.8 ounce device is not unfathomable especially coming from Apple. This is different. During my first hours with the iPhone I literally felt nervous.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/waves-creativity/>The waves of creativity</a></h2>
<h3>Thursday, May 17, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>There are a lot of environmental factors that go into fostering a creative environment. As creative persons mature, we become more in-tune with what works best for us when it&rsquo;s time to dream up new ideas and solutions. Some of us trek to coffeehouses while others listen to Bach, Satie or Mogwai. Whatever we do we&rsquo;re all essentially trying to achieve a certain state of mind.
Before I go any further here is a quick explanation of the human brain by neuronal scientist, Richard Restak (/people/richard-m-restak/):</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/transmedia-newspapers/>Transmedia newspapers</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, May 6, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I just finished reading chapter three of Convergence Culture (/library/books/convergence-culture/) where Jenkins discusses transmedia storytelling. He focuses on the Matrix franchise and how it basically rewrote the rules for Hollywoods future. It got me thinking on my walk home from the coffeehouse, why aren&rsquo;t newspapers doing this?
We&rsquo;re all familiar with the Matrix and have varying depths of involvement with it. Most of us have seen the first film, some the second and third but have any of us played the video game, or seen the Animatrix, or been to Matrix Online (http://www.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/ljworld-redesign/>LJWorld redesign</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, May 2, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>So for the past five months or so we&rsquo;ve been working on a redesign for the Lawrence Journal-World. For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a daily newspaper that circulates the town of Lawrence, Kansas. It&rsquo;s quite small compared to surrounding markets which makes it very agile and free from shareholders and their evil agendas.
I had a feeling this project would be special and challenging but I had no idea of the scale.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/javascript-flash-round-2/>Javascript Flash round 2</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, April 20, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>FIguring out the Javascript/Flash integration kit has lead to a much simpler solution. Looks like Macromedia has slipped in another nugget of usefulness in the Flash 8 release which, I might add, has penetrated the market remarkably fast. It&rsquo;s called External Interface. I gotta thank Bobby for finding this one.
So forget the last post if you&rsquo;re a progressive designer like myself, marching to the Flash 8 bugle. Using the same example as before replace your Actionscript with the following.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/inspectdb-rescue/>InspectDB to the rescue</a></h2>
<h3>Thursday, April 19, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>In a past life I used to build admin tools using Ruby on Rails. I thoroughly enjoyed spending weekends improving my little tools and libraries but I eventually realized I was spending more time on back-end stuff than front-end. Enter Django. For the past nine months I&rsquo;ve touched nothing but Django so you can imagine how easy it was for me to hop on the Rails bicycle when Dreamhost decided to upgrade Rails.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/bringing-back-personal/>Bringing back the personal</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, April 11, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard wisperings about the death of blogs lately. More and more we see our favorite writters fading into the ether. This begs the question, what next? What do we do with the barren ghost towns that once thrived on eager readers making sure their cache was cleared before stalking their favorites.
Personal sites should be cornucopias which chronicle our lives. They should be open sketchbooks crammed with a maze of twists and turns.</p>
