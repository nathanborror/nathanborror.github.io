<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/rules-rule/>Rules Rule</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, April 17, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>As children we grew up hating curfew, as adolescence we rebelled against the drinking age, and as adults we shake our fists at stop lights and speed limits. What we don&rsquo;t realize is rules set us free.
I came across this simple notion in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&rsquo;s book Flow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/). By having laws and rules we free ourselves from contemplating things that have already been determined. This provides a framework for thought which is valuable when applied to design.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/my-easter/>My Easter</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, April 16, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Woke up around 11:30 after a long night of coding (http://www.rubyonrails.com). Had a turkey sandwich and some pretzels while watching some television (http://www.historychannel.com). Packed up some essentials: laptop (http://www.apple.com/powerbook/), couple (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/) books (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024114/), and headphones (http://www.stanc.net/eggo/). Drove to the cafe (http://www.broadwaycafeandroastery.com) that breaks for no resurrection. Had a soy latte while improving some Rails code and listening to some music (http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=2960659&amp;amp;s=143441). Then I came home, worked out, read (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007655/), and listened to some piano.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/jason-collett/>Jason Collett</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, April 6, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Just got back from a session with Jason Collett (http://www.arts-crafts.ca/jasoncollett/) from Broken Social Scene (http://www.arts-crafts.ca/bss/). I highly recommend checking this man out. Has sort of a modern day Bob Dylan appeal with fresh percussion. Their newest album, Idols of Exile, offers quaint morsels of Canadian goodness. If you&rsquo;re in need of something fresh and lighthearted, look no further. I only wish Mrs. Feist could have made an appearance.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/after-sxsw/>After SXSW</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, March 14, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I already miss waking up in the morning and planning my day at the Hide Out over a cup of joe. I miss that walk from 7th and Congress to the convention center seeing fellow lanyards. More importantly I miss seeing those who contribute so much to the beautiful corners of our web.
There were some great panel lineups and as much as I love hearing about tech and code I felt like distancing myself from the technical aspects of our industry and focus on listening to what others had to say about the roles psychology and sociology play in what we do.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/gooey-plastic/>Gooey Plastic</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, March 5, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>At what point does interactive design become temporal art over plastic art? This question seems to be rare yet extremely important in our decision making process. This (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/) book prompted my pondering of this.
To clarify, temporal art includes poetry, writing, film and music. Plastic art takes the form of painting, drawing and sculpture. What sets the two apart is that fourth dimension, time. The success of temporal art is in its progressive events leading up to a fulfilling end, better known as climax.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/visualize-then-talk/>Visualize Then Talk</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, March 4, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>One of my favorite quotes from the Godfather trillogy is when Michael Corleone wisly reminds Vinnie, &ldquo;never let anyone know what you are thinking.&rdquo;
The importance of this is astronomical in client meetings. Never bring new ideas to the table in a client meeting. Bring vetted ideas. Prepare yourself before the meeting. Have concept sessions with colleagues, visualize the ideas, make sure you have the resources and be sure the idea is possible.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/make-it-better/>Make It Better</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, February 27, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Bored tonight so I thought I&rsquo;d impregnate some coders out there with some of my seed. My hopes are that this will cause you to give birth to better code. I am pro choice so if you choose to abort I understand whole heartedly. Before you do so please consider adoption, there are plenty of other good coders out there that may benefit.
Ok, enough metaphors. This is some actionscript I did over Christmas (download code (/code/flash_template.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/waking-right/>Waking The Right</a></h3>
<h4>Thursday, February 23, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Thank God it&rsquo;s Friday. I&rsquo;m planning another one of my &ldquo;introvert retreats.&rdquo; About two weeks ago at 5 o&rsquo;clock CST I turned off all forms of communication. The following day I drove to Lawrence, Kansas sans laptop. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like anything too special but the resulting clarity and relaxation was well worth it.
This weekend I&rsquo;ll be cutting it a little short so I can be somewhat social Saturday night. The trip to Lawrence is a go and I&rsquo;ll be invading an undisclosed dark coffee house chugging away on my laptop.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/did-you-know/>Did You Know</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, February 21, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I work with a small team of designers inside a very large ad agency (http://www.bernstein-rein.com). Like most ad agencies they focus primarily on print and broadcast. Having a small web division can sometimes cause confusion between the different mediums.
I never really realized how different web was from print and broadcast until my time at an agency. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a quick list of a few items that I think set web apart.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/explaination/>An Explaination</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, February 18, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>When the name Playground Blues was chosen I was a junior in college. It didn&rsquo;t carry much meaning other than playgrounds seemed like whimsical places where imagination wondered. I feel I&rsquo;ve grown out of the name.
Playground Blues has meant a lot to me. It&rsquo;s enjoyed roughly five official redesigns, god knows how many unofficial. It&rsquo;s been featured on many sites including The Daily Report (http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot) by Jeffrey Zeldman, Moluv (http://www.</p>
