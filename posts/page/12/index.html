<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/farewell-and-hello/>Farewell and Hello</a></h2>
<h3>Monday, May 2, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>This is my last week at my current employer, Look and Feel which would explain my lack of good posts. I can&rsquo;t express how fortunate I am to have spent time with the fine lads of LaF. I will miss them dearly, although, I&rsquo;ll still be living in the neighborhood so I&rsquo;m sure our paths will cross.
My near future rests at a place called Method within Bernstein-Rein. A fortune teller has forcasted very long hours but many laughs and Belgium beer flowing from the hill tops.</p>

<h3>Saturday, April 30, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Time to chim in on Tiger. Dashboard, Spotlight, Automator, Oh My! I was worried at first, things were slow and hard drive was crankin'. Once Spotlight finished indexing my mess of over six years of files I breathed a sigh of relief.
Apple has posted a handy little Dashboard Programming Guide with all sorts of design guidlines and API info. They have done the same for Automator. This little app can save scary amounts of time.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/php-on-rails/>PHP on Rails</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, April 19, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Ruby buzz has been making its rounds these last few months. I&rsquo;m anxious to use Rails but my ISP nor my employer support it. So I&rsquo;ve been stuck staring at the colorful lollypop from a distance.
Cake may be the solution to my problems, at least until Ruby becomes more widely supported. Cake is a PHP framework based on the Rails design. It&rsquo;s still in its infancy but it looks pretty solid.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/selling-your-soul/>Selling Your Soul</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, April 13, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth with my colleagues regarding pre-built admin tools. My position has been the benefits of adopting a framework outweigh any off-the-shelf tool.
What is the difference between a framework and an off-the-shelf system? It&rsquo;s like buying fake plants instead of real ones. off-the-shelf products leave very little wiggle room for growth and are inevitably more than what you need. They also exhibit poor usability, with there shiny plastic leaves and all.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/soft-launch/>Soft Launch</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, April 12, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>This launch is softer than a baby&rsquo;s bum. Please excuse the possible broken links, sparse content, grayed out links, and unusually shaped big toe.
Things should be up to speed by the end of this week so keep checking back from time to time. Also, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll throw you a me update:
I&rsquo;m done photo blogging. It was fun while it lasted but I&rsquo;m out of good photos so back to writing.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/broken-window-theory/>Broken Window Theory</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, April 8, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve become a little obsessed with the &ldquo;Broken Window Theory.&rdquo; I was introduced to this theory by Travis and Charlie. Soon after, it began popping into my head at work, home, or while I was coding. Then I started noticing it in books and on the radio.
The theory is normally applied to urban decay and crime, however, it can be applied to almost anything. How did your apartment get so dirty?</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/double-the-pleasure/>Double the Pleasure</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, November 7, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Last night two new albums pitched a tent on my &ldquo;oh my god&rdquo; list of music. The Faint &ldquo;Wet From Birth&rdquo; and Tom Waits &ldquo;Real Gone&rdquo; are so unbelievably necessary I don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;re still reading. Go get them!
The Faint marches forward with its sexy themes and lucius lyrics. My uncertainties about how they would top Blank-Wave Arcade were shattered by the first track and continued to crumble through track two until they were disintegrated with &ldquo;Southern Belles in London Sing.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kansas-city-migration/>Kansas City Migration</a></h2>
<h3>Saturday, November 6, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve successfully migrated to Downtown Kansas City from Springfield. It took about a week to get all my stuff in order and my mind is catching up.
Tried Middle Eastern food for the first time, go Gyros! If you haven&rsquo;t had Chile Relleno I suggest you dart to a good Mexican restaurant and give it a taste.
The First Friday Art Walk happened to be last friday. Hammerpress unveiled their Christmas collection.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/yo-la-weekend/>Yo La Weekend</a></h2>
<h3>Monday, October 4, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>This weekend I saw Yo La Tengo for the first time in Kansas City. Definitely worth the bones if they&rsquo;re in your area. Amazing jams and a really hot drummer girl. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them I recommend first getting &ldquo;I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Summer Sun.&rdquo; If your hooked you&rsquo;ll also like &ldquo;And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.&rdquo;
Also did a little apartment hunting before I begin playing/working with the fine lads at Look and Feel.</p>
