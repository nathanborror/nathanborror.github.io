<p>Interface consistency is one of those things that, if done correctly, should go unnoticed. I&rsquo;ve slowly been working on a new interface for a side project and thought it&rsquo;d be a treat to share my approach.</p>
<p>Interfaces evolve based on the needs of people using them. Each task may require a different element. Common elements include buttons, dialogs, drop-downs, select boxes, checkboxes, input fields, etc. These elements are like notes in a composition seeking harmony.</p>
<p>To ensure harmony I&rsquo;ll arrange my elements on a single canvas and show the different levels of interaction. By doing this I can easily spot inconstancies. This also helps build a style guide for future elements and interaction.</p>
<p>This is not groundbreaking by any means. Just thought I&rsquo;d share and help promote the practice :)</p>
