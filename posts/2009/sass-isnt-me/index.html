<p>I&rsquo;ve been window shopping the CSS preprocessor world the last week or so. <a href=http://sass-lang.com>Sass</a> seems to be everyone&rsquo;s new bicycle but it hasn&rsquo;t won me over and here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a new syntax that I don&rsquo;t want to learn or support. I have an awesome job where we often hire new people and (hopefully) acquire new clients and the last thing I want is the added friction of having to teach (and sell) a new styling syntax.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a terrible idea for a CSS preprocessor to be whitespace sensitive. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love whitespace sensitive languages. It&rsquo;s why I use Python and think YAML is a Zen like experience, however, I&rsquo;m one of those nut jobs that puts properties on a single line. I actually <em>do</em> this for readability. I can scan a document of single line CSS like nobodies business. Sass looks pretty on the tutorial pages restricted to five lines but when 622 lines of CSS balloons to 3,000+ my insides begin to hurt and so does my scroll wheel. A lot of zealots (I kid again) are going to say, &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re going to support native CSS syntax (<a href=http://nex-3.com/posts/83-sass-and-less>http://nex-3.com/posts/83-sass-and-less</a>) like LessCSS!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s great, why? They should have either started with this or not done it at all. Good luck supporting two syntaxes.</li>
<li>Why the frak do I need control directives in CSS? If I&rsquo;m using a @for loop to generate styles I&rsquo;m doing something very wrong. CSS is not a programming language, it&rsquo;s a style language and the preprocessor community should keep that in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>My rants aside, we can learn a lot from Sass. Variables, mixins, and nested rules are a great idea and lead to cleaner code. Why can&rsquo;t we spice up CSS and make a preprocessor that just does a few things incredibly well? <a href=http://lesscss.org>LessCSS</a> has been a great example of this, but what about a preprocessor that compiles CSS3 down to CSS2? With any luck <strong>the preprocessor community has the potential to greatly influence the CSS language</strong> by showing the W3C how people want to use it. This is a better direction than creating unnecessary friction by devising a completely new syntax for everyone to adopt.</p>
