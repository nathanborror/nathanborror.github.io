<p><strong>Sass isn't for me</strong> â€” I've been window shopping the CSS preprocessor world the last week or so. <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> seems to be everyone's new bicycle but it hasn't won me over and here's why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It's a new syntax that I don't want to learn or support. I have an awesome job where we often hire new people and (hopefully) acquire new clients and the last thing I want is the added friction of having to teach (and sell) a new styling syntax.</li>
  <li>It's a terrible idea for a CSS preprocessor to be whitespace sensitive. Don't get me wrong, I love whitespace sensitive languages. It's why I use Python and think YAML is a Zen like experience, however, I'm one of those nut jobs that puts properties on a single line. I actually _do_ this for readability. I can scan a document of single line CSS like nobodies business. Sass looks pretty on the tutorial pages restricted to five lines but when 622 lines of CSS balloons to 3,000+ my insides begin to hurt and so does my scroll wheel. A lot of zealots (I kid again) are going to say, "But they're going to <a href="http://nex-3.com/posts/83-sass-and-less">support native CSS syntax</a> like <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LessCSS</a>!" That's great, why? They should have either started with this or not done it at all. Good luck supporting two syntaxes.</li>
  <li>Why the frak do I need <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/SASS_REFERENCE.md.html#control_directives">control directives</a> in CSS? If I'm using a @for loop to generate styles I'm doing something very wrong. CSS is not a programming language, it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_language">style language</a> and the preprocessor community should keep that in mind.</li>
</ol>

<p>My rants aside, we can learn a lot from Sass. Variables, mixins, and nested rules are a great idea and lead to cleaner code. Why can't we spice up CSS and make a preprocessor that just does a few things incredibly well? <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LessCSS</a> has been a great example of this, but what about a preprocessor that compiles CSS3 down to CSS2? With any luck **the preprocessor community has the potential to greatly influence the CSS language** by showing the W3C how people want to use it. This is a better direction than creating unnecessary friction by devising a completely new syntax for everyone to adopt.</p>
