<p>I spent a while last weekend thinking about death and privacy—for no particular
reason aside from taking notice of a couple books I own:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://readernaut.com/books/0807842303/>The Adams Jefferson Letters</a></li>
<li><a href=http://readernaut.com/books/0670021946/>Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg: The Letters</a></li>
<li><a href=http://readernaut.com/books/006171142X/>Rub Out the Words: The Letters of William S. Burroughs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are countless collections of correspondence floating around from a time
when an envelope was considered a form of privacy. In many cases privacy died
with the individual. Today we converse within systems where death has no effect
on privacy and this seems very unfortunate. We&rsquo;ve created an environment where
insight is forever locked-up.</p>
