Blogs, zines, news articles all
suffer from &ldquo;out with the old, in with the new&rdquo; mentality. There is a lot of
old content that retains relevancy far beyond its publish date. The problem is,
how do we resurrect it?</p><p>Simple, stats tracking. Amazon solved this problem a long time ago. They
meticulously track peoples browsing and buying habits and offer up
recommendations based on trends. Chris Anderson&rsquo;s article from 2004, The Long
Tail (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html</a>) will really blow your
skirt up. Anderson starts off by explaining how Joe Simpson&rsquo;s book, Touching the
Void (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060730552/)">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060730552/)</a>, brought little fan fair in 1988
until ten years latter when Amazon noticed the buying trends of a new title,
Into Thin Air (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385494785/">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385494785/</a>) by Jon Krakauer. Amazon&rsquo;s
recommendation algorithm began serving up<em>Touching the Void</em> as a &ldquo;buy this
book with&hellip;&rdquo; recommendation. Touching the Void ultimately out-sold Into Thin Air.</p><p>Why couldn&rsquo;t the same approach be taken for time insensitive content on sites
like A List Apart, NYTimes, CNN, even this blog? How much relevancy should we
give old content? Stats have always been fun to look at with tools like Mint
(<a href="http://www.haveamint.com">http://www.haveamint.com</a>) and Google Analytics, but when do we start
capitalizing on them and using them in clever ways to help direct our readers
to the content they so desire? How do we make old content the new black?</p>

You can make Javascript and Flash play together! Way back in 2005 the company formerly known as Macromedia threw together a nice<a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/flashjavascript/">little kit</a> to make these two languages play nicely. Here&rsquo;s how.</p><p>First we need to secure some crutial files. The first is a SWF called JavaScriptFlashGateway.swf which allows us to setup a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; between our Flash and Javascript. Second, make sure you link up JavaScriptFlashGateway.js. Third, put JavaScriptSerializer.as and JavaScriptProxy.as in your Actionscript class path so you can import them into your Flash movies.</p><p>Once all that is in place it&rsquo;s time to write some code. For this example I&rsquo;m going to make a ball move across the screen using two input fields in an HTML form which will allow a person to enter X and Y values to move the ball across the screen. Before we can get any further we need establish an ID so things are nice a secure between our Flash and Javascript. We&rsquo;re going to use the current time as our ID like so:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">uid</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> Date().<span style="color:#a6e22e">getTime</span>();<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">flashproxy</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">FlashProxy</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">uid</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">'JavaScriptFlashGateway.swf'</span>);</code></pre></div><p>Now lets add some code to our flash movie. In the first frame add:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">JavaScriptProxy</span>;<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">Ball</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {}<span style="color:#a6e22e">Ball</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">moveBall</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">p_x</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span>Number,<span style="color:#a6e22e">p_y</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span>Number) {<span style="color:#a6e22e">ball_mc</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">_x</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">p_x</span>;<span style="color:#a6e22e">ball_mc</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">_y</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">p_y</span>;
}<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">proxy</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">JavaScriptProxy</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">JavaScriptProxy</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">_root</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">lcId</span>,<span style="color:#a6e22e">Ball</span>);</code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;re simply importing the JavaScriptProxy class and creating a Ball class. The Ball class gets a method called moveBall which is what we&rsquo;ll call via javascript. Notice the JavaScriptProxy is passed our ID that we created earlier and a reference to the Ball class. Lets turn back to our HTML file and add some more Javascript to complete the deal.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">tag</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">FlashTag</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">'flash/ball.swf'</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">400</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">350</span>);<span style="color:#a6e22e">tag</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">setFlashvars</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">'lcId='</span><span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">uid</span>);<span style="color:#a6e22e">tag</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">write</span>(document);<span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">move_ball</span> () {<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">x</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">moveball</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">x</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span>;<span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">y</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span> document.<span style="color:#a6e22e">moveball</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">y</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span>;<span style="color:#a6e22e">flashproxy</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">call</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">"moveBall"</span>,<span style="color:#a6e22e">x</span>,<span style="color:#a6e22e">y</span>)
}</code></pre></div><p>Here we&rsquo;re using the handy FlashTag class to embed our ball.swf into our page. We&rsquo;re also passing the ID we created earlier, very important. The move_ball function is what we&rsquo;ll call upon submission of the HTML form. It uses the flashproxy instance to call our Actionscript method &ldquo;moveBall&rdquo; passing it the x and y coordinates into the SWF thus moving the ball.</p><p>Hope this makes a little sense. The code can be<a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/media/source/JavaScript_Flash_Tutorial.zip">downloaded here</a> or you can just look at it<a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/media/source/JavaScript_Flash_Tutorial/">here</a>. I&rsquo;ve also created<a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/laboratory/">another example</a> that utilizes a Flash video player and playlist. You can also call Javascript functions from within your Flash movie. There is one gotcha that I&rsquo;ve come across in order to do this. Be sure to set the Flash parameter allowScriptAccess to &ldquo;always&rdquo;. Otherwise communication from Flash to Javascript won&rsquo;t work.</p>

two incredibly broad terms with unforeseeable outcomes. Convergence has been
vogue for a while and I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about its usage to describe media
convergence. At this years SXSW, for the first time, someone summed up what
I&rsquo;ve been trying to understand.</p><p>When I think of convergence I do so in terms of the classic media outlets
converging with the Internet. There is a lot of convergence rhetoric at my job
and in the field of news. Advertising is also experiencing the pains of
understanding what the web is and how to leverage it. Convergence seems more
like a trojan horse to me, creeping into peoples minds making them think it will
deliver harmony between old and new. It&rsquo;s just not true.</p><p>While old media tries to &ldquo;converge&rdquo; over the next few years we&rsquo;re going to see
more Salon&rsquo;s, Newsvine&rsquo;s, and Digg&rsquo;s take over. They&rsquo;ll do so because they don&rsquo;t
have to change old minds. The Google / Viacom battle

will be nothing short of entertaining. This is how the old always dies off,
clinging to what they know and understand.</p>

From what I gather there are three
flavors: a simple &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method, a thumbs up or down, and the scale. Each
solutions goal is to find out what people think of your content. This is helpful
when trying to understand your audience.</p><h1 id="the-one-vote-method">The &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method</h1><p>As simple as it gets. If someone likes a piece of content they simply click a
button saying so. Nothing more nothing less. This is a visceral response, a
&ldquo;blink&rdquo; reaction which requires minimal thought. The downside is you can&rsquo;t infer
that a non-vote means people dislike content. A non-vote most likely means they
didn&rsquo;t read the content enough to care which could suggest weak content but it&rsquo;s
a little grey.</p><h1 id="thumbs-up-thumbs-down">Thumbs up, thumbs down</h1><p>This one makes me think of Siskel and Ebert and their black and white critiques
of film. Probably the most widely used style because of its simplicity. Like
the &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method, it relies on gut reactions but allows people to express
their dislike for a piece of content. The style sometimes borrows the
visualization side of the scale system below.</p><h1 id="scale">Scale</h1><p>Frequently represented as stars, we commonly see this method used along with
reviews and entertainment ratings. This system requires the most amount of
thought from a person which often leads to poor return. It&rsquo;s best used in
situations where a person is investing time into writing a review.</p><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>Implementing a rating system isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart. You need to be
comfortable with powers of online democracy. Oddly enough rating systems are
why Google works. They&rsquo;re Page Rank system is based almost entirely on the
&ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method where a link from one site to another stands as a &ldquo;vote.&rdquo;

christmas shopping last week and stumbled into a Sony Style story. I&rsquo;m not a fan
of the Sony brand but they do seem to come out with some daring devices. The
first thing that struck me was the Sony Reader (<a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/)">http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/)</a>.</p><p>The Sony Reader is basically a very thin screen that uses E-Ink technology
(<a href="http://eink.com/">http://eink.com/</a>) to display text and basic graphics. The resolution is
shocking, it&rsquo;s like staring at a piece of paper. The device has a lot of
problems and the operating system is pretty clunky and locked down but you can
tell this is the beginning of something.</p><p>One thing is for certain, this dawn of reader devices will kill print. They will
get vibrant colors, more responsive interfaces, and durability. You can bet other
companies are developing their own devices and this is the end of the road for
print and it&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>

Coffeehouse, well, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you who wins.</p><p>In the next half decade we&rsquo;ll most likely have access to any book imaginable
through the use of a single device. Whether we like this idea or not it will at
some point replace the role of the book. Books have lived a long life when
compared to the Music medium. Music has been on a steady pace of evolution from
vinyl to eight track to cassette to CD and now digital. Digital seems to be the
evolutionary end because it&rsquo;s intangible. Google is hard at work scanning the
Worlds books which are longing for a digital resting place.</p><p>Do Libraries become insignificant when digital books reach a tipping point? Not
unless they transform their role as repositories of knowledge to places of
gathering. Nothing can replace face to face interactions. When we gain knowledge
we ultimately seek understanding.</p><p>When Open Source infected the programming world it became one of the most
significant movements in history. The speed with which we&rsquo;ve created the
Information Age would not have been possible without this movement. If Libraries
applied the Open Source philosophy to Education they could usher in the dawn of
a new age, The Age of Education. This could rival some of the best Universities.
This wouldn&rsquo;t be a normal teacher/class education. The books would be our
teachers. People would roam the halls seeking other people. Understanding would
be gained through discussion and debate. Some of us would travel long distances
to Libraries famous for their people and discussions.</p><p>For centuries Libraries have been entrusted with housing knowledge. That trust
is quickly being handed over to the Internet. Libraries now have the opportunity
to be handed the trust of understanding.</p><p>The preceding was sparked by some plans I saw for a new Library to be built in
my town of Lawrence, Kansas. The design feels so open and welcoming with its
huge windows and roof top gardens. It has a sense of curiosity with it&rsquo;s
inconsistent fourth floor appearing to look in a different direction than the
other floors. It feels like a place I would go to have conversations and seek
understanding.</p>

What&rsquo;s amazing is the story data can tell just by being represented in a simple
fashion using basic design principles.</p><p>Tonight was a thrill and it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if it wasn&rsquo;t for the
hard work and dedication that our team has towards delivering data to its

on an em&rsquo;s and percentages for layout and font sizing. Why would someone take
such drastic measures? Two simple reasons: usability and flexibility.</p><p>The current Domaki, circa Fall 2006, uses this practice which makes the liquid
layout possible with ease. A non-liquid example would be the Ellington
(<a href="http://www.ellingtoncms.com">http://www.ellingtoncms.com</a>) site which uses a container set in EM&rsquo;s with all
inner layers set to percentages. When you increase the font size the layout
scales appropriately, thus demonstrating good usability (or accessibility &ndash; I
think they are one in the same).</p><p>Have you ever stood back and wondered, &ldquo;should this site be wider?&rdquo; Well with
one miniscule change it can. Simply alter the container layer and everything
follows suite as long as your inner layers have all been assigned percentages.
The biggest caveat to this is dealing with IE not behaving well with 100% in
certain situations. I&rsquo;ve gotten around this by trying not to be so pixel perfect
and looking at things more loosely. Upon doing more and more complex column
layouts I&rsquo;ve come to love this method of styling.</p><p>It&rsquo;s time to see more liquid layouts or at least taking into consideration that
the canvas we have is not fixed. Most of the software applications on our
computer are liquid why not web sites?</p><p>Tip: Set the font-style property of the body tag to 62.5%. This makes 1em look
like 10px, and so on.</p>

course as part of the Electronic Arts program. The first day of class we
received a typical syllabus and course schedule. Then we immediately dove into a
topic that I still remember to this day, Gestalt psychology.</p><p>In its basic form, Gestalt tries to explain how we perceive more than the
collected sum. Musical tunes can be recognized in different keys or with added
notes. Instead of seeing individual leafs on a tree we see branches, birds, sky,
and grass. Foreground and background blend together to create a complete picture.
&ldquo;&hellip; although a wheel is made of 30 spokes, it is the space between the spokes
that determines the overall form.&rdquo; &ndash; Tao Te Ching</p><p>Designers juggle their time between foreground and background elements with the
hopes of ensuring a harmony between the two. If one is neglected the design can
easily fail; becoming more aware of this can help produce a more desirable
composition.</p><p>One of the last remaining original Gestalt psychologists, Rudolf Arnheim,
recently referred to the decline of modern design as, &ldquo;unbrilled extravagance, a
vulgarity of taste, and triviality of thought.&rdquo; I see a lot of evidence
supporting this statement on a daily basis. My conscious tells me design should
be timeless. Instead of spending hours trying to determine the new fad we should
be researching the psychological effects of design and closely study the masters.
This is the path I&rsquo;ve decided to try for now.</p><p>More on Gestalt:</p><ul><li>Gestalt psychology (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology</a>) (wikipedia)</li><li>Society for Gestalt theory (<a href="http://gestalttheory.net/archive/index.html">http://gestalttheory.net/archive/index.html</a>)</li><li>Gestalt principles (<a href="http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm">http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm</a>)</li></ul>

I was able to get the
Domaki code under version control (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control</a>)
which I highly recommend. It allows you to kick FTP to the curb and do
everything with &ldquo;svn commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; commands.</p><p>The main reason for doing this was my extreme inability to remember which files
I&rsquo;ve changed. Subversion (<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>) takes the worry out of
my day by committing the necessary files from my local machine to my repository.
I can then update my live site copy with a simple update command. My setup is
pretty simple. My repository is on Dreamhost. I have have a local copy checked
out on my laptop where I make my changes. I have another copy checked out on
Dreamhost thats served up fresh to you. I commit changes via my local terminal
and ssh to my live directory on Dreamhost to update the code to the latest
version. Pretty simple!</p><p>Trac (<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">http://trac.edgewall.org/</a>) is also handy for navigating the repository
online but acts more as a project management tool. Anytime I come across a bug
or a UI enhancement I can open a ticket to Trac which can be closed upon
completion. It can also review and compare changes of any file if you ever have
to roll a file back to an older version.</p><p>Textmate (<a href="http://macromates.com/">http://macromates.com/</a>) has some handy Subversion key commands but I
haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fully explore them.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re using Django or Python make sure you edit your config file under your
hidden .subversion directory to exclude .pyc files. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be making a
ton of unnecessary file updates.</p>

allows the public to comment on online stories. Quick note: while I may work for
the newspaper my experience with journalism at the time of this post is very
informal. I am a member of the public, which in my opinion makes this opinion
just as valid as any.</p><p>Journalists have an obligation to participate in the public discourse so long as
they adhere to the principles of journalistic (<a href="http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles">http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles</a>)
integrity. The delivery of news over an interactive medium allows for a closer
relationship between a journalist and their audience. Why should a journalist
end a story at the last sentence? Journalists sort through a variety of data to
form their story which makes their participation essential in discussing or
correcting the presented, edited data.</p><p>Journalism&rsquo;s purpose is to strengthen communities. Journalist forum
participation not only enhances a story, it bridges the perceived gap between
journalist and reader. I would even bet that over time it would increase
participation and readership.</p>

into the world of Rails like every other designer wannabe programmer. I&rsquo;ll be
honest, I did it because everyone else was. Looking back I don&rsquo;t really know
why, I just followed the &ldquo;if it feels good, do it&rdquo; principle.</p><p>Out of that decision grew a love/hate relationship. I&rsquo;m primarily a designer but
I like sticking my hands in the programming cookie jar. I appreciate things that
just work, offering few opportunities for me to unknowingly screw something up.
Looking back, most of my time was spent developing admin tools, troubleshooting
500 errors, and deployment. For some reason I accepted this as the norm, and to
some degree, enjoyed it. It was like tinkering with a train set (no pun intended).
Until I saw a job posting (<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/26/designer-wanted/)">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/26/designer-wanted/)</a>.</p><p>World Online was seeking a senior designer to lead its commercial projects. I
was interested but it meant no more Rails and I&rsquo;d have to gain a fundamental
understanding of Django, a Python web development framework. This intrigued me.
I remember hearing whispers of Django at SXSW in March. I knew there was no way
I could seriously apply for the job if I didn&rsquo;t believe in Django as I did Rails.</p><p>After two weeks and with the aid of some great online documentation, I released
(/posts/2006/jun/26/80x80/) a new personal site. I was sold, and not just
because there was a carrot dangling in-front of me. Realizing I would never have
to make another admin tool allowed me the exhale and start dreaming up better
designs, info-graphics, API usages, and relationships between content. Django
was an instrument that, with little instruction, I could enjoy playing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been little over a month and I&rsquo;m still playing. So far, Django has kept a
steady beat. No more 500 errors, no more building admin tools, and it&rsquo;s freakin
fast. It should be noted that I have no ill feelings towards Rails. It&rsquo;s a great
framework but the benefits Django offer me, as a designer, are just too great.
Plus I took the job so I have to use it :)</p><p>For those of you wanting to make a similar switch, I encourage it. Here are some
resources that may help:</p><ul><li>Django overview (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/overview/">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/overview/</a>)</li><li>Writing your first Django app (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial1/">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial1/</a>)</li><li>Django for non-programmers (<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/02/django-non-programmers/">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/02/django-non-programmers/</a>)</li><li>Are you generic? (<a href="http://www.wilsonminer.com/posts/2006/may/10/are-you-generic/">http://www.wilsonminer.com/posts/2006/may/10/are-you-generic/</a>)</li><li>Setting up Django on Dreamhost (<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/11/django-dreamhost/">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/11/django-dreamhost/</a>)</li></ul><p>The Django community is very welcoming. The online documentation is well written
and oddly fun to read. I gained a lot from looking at the actual Django website
code (<a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/djangoproject.com/django_website">http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/djangoproject.com/django_website</a>)
and listening in the irc channel (#django). It&rsquo;s also worth reading the philosophy
(<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/design_philosophies/">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/design_philosophies/</a>) behind Django.</p><p>The popular decision isn&rsquo;t always the right one. This is pretty obvious to most.
I think Django Reinhardt said it best, &ldquo;Jazz attracted me because in it I found
a formal perfection and instrumental precision that I admire in classical music,
but which popular music doesn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; I believe Django (framework) lives up to
this perfection and precision Mr. Reinhardt speaks of.</p>

Today marks a big tweak including a name change,
site realignment, and a fun little visualization project. Welcome to Domaki
(pronounced Du·mock·eee), formerly &ldquo;You know where you are&rdquo; and
formally &ldquo;Playground Blues.&rdquo; I am your host, Nathan Borror.</p><h1 id="whats-changed">Whats changed?</h1><p>All the markup has been overhauled. I&rsquo;ve been fine tuning a particular CSS
framework that is a derivative of the YUI framework (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/</a>)
over at Yahoo. Dimensions are based on percentages and em&rsquo;s which allow the
interface to scaled up, down, out or in. It also makes it very easy to achieve
liquid layouts. The back end is still Django with very little changes. (Beware
IE users, still flushing out some annoying bugs.)</p><h1 id="tumbling">Tumbling</h1><p>I added a &ldquo;tumblelog&rdquo; using some of Jacob&rsquo;s (<a href="http://www.jacobian.org/">http://www.jacobian.org/</a>) code.
It&rsquo;s visible on the homepage. This basically gathers all my photos, bookmarks,
comments and even webcam freezes and spits them out at once. Over the weekend I
threw together a visualization using Flash which can be viewed (<a href="http://www.domaki.com/labs/)">http://www.domaki.com/labs/)</a>.
It should be fun to see what other visualizations I can dream up.</p><h1 id="webcam-freeze">Webcam Freeze</h1><p>The webcam (<a href="http://www.domaki.com/webcam/">http://www.domaki.com/webcam/</a>) is back! I&rsquo;ve retooled the layout
and it should be easy as pie to freeze a moment of my time and attach a comment
to it. All the old freezes are back up too. I still think this is pretty unique.
I&rsquo;d be interested to know if anyone else has spied something similar.</p><h1 id="so-why-the-name-change">So why the name change?</h1><p>I wanted something short and simple. I didn&rsquo;t like &lsquo;Playground Blues&rsquo; because it
had a color in the name which seemed kind of cheesy. I liked &lsquo;You know where you
are&rsquo; but got tired of typing it. While staring at my bulletin board one day I
noticed this little character (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/223203462/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/223203462/</a>)
with the name &lsquo;dodo maki.&rsquo; It sounded goofy and interesting. I reduced it to six
letters and bought the domain (btw: available six letter domains are becoming
pretty rare these days). It doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of meaning now but thats the
beauty of new brands, over time it&rsquo;s meaning will grow and some day, who knows,
it might be added to Websters :)</p>

Today we
face a new battle called privacy. I bring this up because in todays Lawrence
Journal-World Sarah Benson wrote an interesting article titled Facebook
indiscretions plague users (<a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/)">http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/)</a>.</p><p>In her article she gives two examples of the unintended consequences of social
networking. The first outlines how an employer can peer into prospective
employees social pasts using current employee accounts. The second explains how
a group of students, toasting to the university alcohol policy in the comforts
of their dorm, got caught by university officials discovering photos in a users
profile.</p><p>This is somewhat frightening in a Flickr, MySpace, Friendster, Facebook, Google,
Del.icio.us world. With ease I can pick a person discover last nights party pics,
a detailed description of what movies, music, and body type they are, what
searches they performed last night and what websites they felt worthy of
remembering. This may seem harmless but when aggregated, opinions form, and
worse yet form out of context.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem sharing my photos (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/)">http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/)</a>,

me well may take them out of context. While privacy is societies hurdle in the
coming years I think we as individuals need to be reminded of the importance of
context.</p>

bullshit. It&rsquo;s the reason why most companies are selfless and full of boring
individuals with zero curiosity or ownership. If companies want to captivate our
minds they have to do it through soul. Catchy logos and tag lines are important
but if the people of a company lack class or style, the products will too.</p><p>When I know whose behind a great product, I appreciate it so much more. This can
also carry many dangers as I&rsquo;m sure we all know. In particular, retirement or

Instead, I
quickly fell into a dream state which is the plague of many Sunday mornings. I
felt guilty about being so unproductive, but, I had no pressing deadlines, no
urgent emails, no clients knocking at my door. Later that night I felt a surge
of creativity and began painting, which got me wondering. Lets see what Brenda
Ueland (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555972608/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555972608/</a>) says:</p><blockquote><p>Our idea that we must always be energetic and active is all wrong. Bernard
Shaw says that it is not true that Napoleon was always snapping out decisions
to a dozen secretaries and aides-de-camp, as we are told, but that he moodled
around for months. Of course he did. And that is why these smart, energetic,
do-it-now, pushing people so often say: &ldquo;I am not creative.&rdquo; They are, but
they should be idle, limp and alone for much of the time, as lazy as men
fishing on a levee, and quietly looking and thinking, not<em>willing</em> all the
time.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s important to make time for nothing. It allows you to open your mind to
thought you might not normally invite in. In a way, these moments cultivate our
creative fields. When it&rsquo;s time to harvest, ideas should be ripe for the
pickings. Basically, the answers we arrive at are a result of past thought.
Neglect these moments and you limit the quality of creative outcomes.</p><p>&ldquo;Some 40 thousand (and counting) elementary schools have eliminated recess in
favor of more time for academics,&rdquo; says David Elkind (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738210536/)">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738210536/)</a>.
This is shocking. From what I recall, recess was the most rejuvenating part of
my elementary day. &ldquo;Our schools are now contributing to the suppression of
curiosity, imagination and fantasy.&rdquo;</p><p>As we get older we unknowingly loose touch with our creative side and our
imagination. I remember looking at clouds and immediately spotting frogs, space
ships or elephants. Now I have to concentrate to come up with anything. Making
time for relaxing and dreaming is so important, if for no other reason than to
look up and see a giraffe float by.</p>

using Python and Django. The solution is quite flexible aside from the fact that
the Del.icio.us API is still under development.</p><p>I started by studying FlickrClient (<a href="http://micampe.it/things/flickrclient">http://micampe.it/things/flickrclient</a>) which
is a great interface for Python. The Flickr API is very verbose and this is a
simple approach that scales to future Flickr upgrades. The power behind this
script is the following method:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> __getattr__(self, method):<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">method</span>(_self<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>self, _method<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>method,<span style="color:#f92672">**</span>params):
_method<span style="color:#f92672">=</span> _method<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>replace(<span style="color:#e6db74">"_"</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">"."</span>)
url<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">"http://flickr.com/services/rest/"</span><span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#e6db74">"?method=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">%s</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;amp;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">%s</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;amp;api_key=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">%s</span><span style="color:#e6db74">"</span><span style="color:#f92672">%</span> (_method, urlencode(params), YOUR_API_KEY)<span style="color:#f92672">...</span></code></pre></div><p>This basically generates the proper URL string to be passed to Flickr. With this
bit of simplicity you can literally call any API method. All thats left is
parsing the return XML value which is done by XMLTramp (<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/xmltramp/)">http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/xmltramp/)</a>.
This will parse any XML data into a useful object that you can iterate through
in a Django template.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">rsp<span style="color:#f92672">=</span> xmltramp<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>load(url)</code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;ve retooled this approach a bit to work with Del.ici.ous. The biggest
difference is instead of using an API Key you have to validate with Https. I
created a method to handle this using urllib2:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">_secureConnect</span>(self, url):
auth_handler<span style="color:#f92672">=</span> urllib2<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>HTTPBasicAuthHandler()
auth_handler<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>add_password(<span style="color:#e6db74">'del.icio.us API'</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">'https://api.del.icio.us'</span>, USERNAME, PASSWORD)
opener<span style="color:#f92672">=</span> urllib2<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>build_opener(auth_handler)
urllib2<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>install_opener(opener)<span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> urllib2<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>urlopen(url)<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>read()</code></pre></div><p>The other big difference is all the data in the return XML resides in attributes
of a single node. (In my opinion this is crap but such is life.) We must create
a new object because Django templates don&rsquo;t seem to like how XMLTramp accesses
node attributes.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> child<span style="color:#f92672">in</span> rsp:
posts<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>append({<span style="color:#e6db74">'description'</span>:child(<span style="color:#e6db74">'description'</span>),<span style="color:#e6db74">'href'</span>:child(<span style="color:#e6db74">'href'</span>),<span style="color:#e6db74">'extended'</span>:child(<span style="color:#e6db74">'extended'</span>),<span style="color:#e6db74">'hash'</span>:child(<span style="color:#e6db74">'hash'</span>),<span style="color:#e6db74">'time'</span>:child(<span style="color:#e6db74">'time'</span>),<span style="color:#e6db74">'tag'</span>:child(<span style="color:#e6db74">'tag'</span>)})<span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> posts</code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;m sure if I become better versed with urllib2 and Python I could make this
simpler. For now it works which was the intended goal. Here is the code
(<a href="http://media.youknowwhereyouare.com/code/DeliciousClient.zip)">http://media.youknowwhereyouare.com/code/DeliciousClient.zip)</a>.<em>Word of
caution!</em> It&rsquo;s good practice to save these results to a local database thereby
minimizing the API requests. Del.icio.us in particular will throttle back your
requests when it notices an increase in API traffic. My next post will address
this.</p>

challenging for me. If you&rsquo;re a close friend then it was probably apparent in
the way I cheaply disguise my emotions. It&rsquo;s not easy to look back at two years
of progress in advertising and realize all along you may have stumbled into the
wrong cocktail party. Once this realization occurs it creeps into all your
thoughts and emotions to the point where you can no longer function until a
change is made.</p><p>I can finally say a change has been made. A weight has been lifted only to be
replaced by reluctant excitement. August will mark my departure from advertising.
I&rsquo;ve never felt comfortable in advertising and while I understand its purpose I
struggle with its effects. So in the midst of my search for a new direction I
discovered an opportunity to fill a void with an exciting group of individuals.</p><p>If your not familiar with the Kansas/Missouri area you may know them for their

you may recognize them as pioneers of an online publishing tool, Ellington

LJWorld.com (<a href="http://www.ljworld.com/)">http://www.ljworld.com/)</a>, and KUSports.com (<a href="http://www.kusports.com/)">http://www.kusports.com/)</a>.
They call themselves World Online and what better place to be with a name like
that than in the center of the country, Lawrence, Kansas.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be doing the impossible task of filling the shoes of Wilson Miner
(<a href="http://www.wilsonminer.com/">http://www.wilsonminer.com/</a>) who has moved on to some small company
(<a href="http://www.apple.com/">http://www.apple.com/</a>) in California that makes a very ambitions music device :)
This was a very difficult decision because I&rsquo;ll be leaving a group of individuals
(<a href="http://www.brmethod.com/">http://www.brmethod.com/</a>) that I have an enormous amount of respect and
admiration for.</p><p>This insainly fast pace industry that we casually call The Web is actually a
very small community of extraordinary human beings. We&rsquo;re infected with
curiosity and rely heavily on one another for direction and friendship. I will

Well, actually, just those that are
guilty of inline javascript. Now don&rsquo;t get all puffed up, I&rsquo;m just as guilty but
it&rsquo;s time to change and I have some tips!</p><p>Over the past couple years we&rsquo;ve heard a lot about separation. Two types, in
particular, have been evangelized, data from structure and structure from style.
One we don&rsquo;t hear about nor see it practiced very often is separation between
structure and behavior. Why do some of us work so hard at protecting data,
structure and style while neglecting behavior?</p><p>For me it&rsquo;s laziness. After designing a site I spend a majority of my time
creating a solid structure then styling. By the time debugging is over I&rsquo;m so
beat, a little inline javascript never hurt anybody, right? Wrong! So how can
I/we change?</p><p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer if your slacking in something, it&rsquo;s probably because it&rsquo;s
not as fun as it could be. So in an effort to liven up javascript I&rsquo;ve decided
to investigate a framework called JQuery (<a href="http://www.jquery.com">http://www.jquery.com</a>). It&rsquo;s similar
to Prototype (<a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">http://prototype.conio.net/</a>) but not as bloated, it slides in at
a polite 10k when compressed and has a handsome toolset. The best part about it
is you find yourself unknowingly abstracting all your code. It&rsquo;s designed with
separation in mind and makes it fun to boot! It also supports XPath
(<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/">http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/</a>) which I haven&rsquo;t really dove into yet but I&rsquo;ve
been assured is quite amazing. Aside from its core functionality its provides
some simple effects, ajax, and basic events.</p><p>So there you have it. We/I have no reason to neglect this important separation
of behavior.</p><p><em>UPDATE</em> Two great articles have surfaced on a similar topic:</p><ul><li>James Bennett: Django and AJAX (<a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/07/02/django-and-ajax">http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/07/02/django-and-ajax</a>)</li><li>Jeremy Keith: Learning JavaScript (<a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/78">http://domscripting.com/blog/display/78</a>)</li></ul>

(<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/settings/#installed-apps">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/settings/#installed-apps</a>) list.</p><p>I created a templatetag but Django is saying the file doesn&rsquo;t exist. First make
sure you have loaded the template tag
(<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#extending-the-template-system)">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#extending-the-template-system)</a>,
(i.e.<code>{% load latestposts %}</code>). Second, and this one gets me every time, make
sure you added the<code>__init__.py</code> file to the newly created directory. This file
must be present in directories that contain python scripts.</p><p>How do I access the children of a many-to-one or many-to-many relationship within
the template? This puzzled me for a while. I&rsquo;m accustomed to saying<code>post.categories</code> but in Django you must say<code>post.categories_set.all</code>. Referenced
here (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/db_api/#related-objects)">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/db_api/#related-objects)</a>.</p><p>I just added my database from my model but I keep getting a 404 error when I try
to view the template. This drove me crazy and people will probably laugh. If you
forget to enter data into the newly formed table Django will throw a Page Not
Found error until you enter your first record of data. It&rsquo;s always the small
things.</p><p>I hope these are somewhat helpful. If you have any to add to the list feel free
to post a comment.</p>

Sometimes things take longer but in my case I
just wanted to compete for attention the same day Digg 3 (<a href="http://www.digg.com">http://www.digg.com</a>)
launched. All amusement aside I&rsquo;d like to take the plastic wrap off my new site
that I&rsquo;ve dubbed 80x80.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming and I&rsquo;ve finally got something I&rsquo;m proud of. She&rsquo;s
still stretching herself out so if you notice any kinks let me know and I&rsquo;ll
call the masseuse. You&rsquo;ll see the<a href="/lab/">Lab</a> grow soon into a dumping ground
for prototypes and ideas. To keep things lively the artwork above will change as
frequently as possible. You may notice the death of my tags, sorry, I opted for
a clear set of categories.<a href="/projects/">Portfolio</a> is simple and should provide
a glimpse of my contributions.<a href="/resume/">Resume</a> is, well, a resume.</p><p>That said, I&rsquo;d like to say a few words on the nuts and bolts. I&rsquo;ve parted ways
with Rails (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">http://www.rubyonrails.com</a>). I enjoy Ruby immensely, it&rsquo;s a
beautiful language and I highly recommend it for those of you building web apps.
However, while I wear many hats, none of them include web app developer. My
largest hat is information designer. I spoon feed content to people in a
stimulating fashion in hopes of planting a brand seed in their brain, thats all.
After a few weeks of tinkering around I realized Django (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">http://www.djangoproject.com</a>)
was my new muse. In less than a weekend I had a prototype for this site which
allowed me to focus directly on usability, design and content while eliminating
time towards an admin tool. Ruby on Rails made programming fun again but Django
liberated me from back-end development.</p><p>I would like to give a big thanks to Jeff Croft
(<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/jun/06/lost-theories-with-source-code/)">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/jun/06/lost-theories-with-source-code/)</a>, Wilson

(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/)">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/)</a>. By having laws and rules we free
ourselves from contemplating things that have already been determined. This
provides a framework for thought which is valuable when applied to design.</p><p>Have you ever noticed how hard it is to be original? Thinking up a completely
new idea from scratch is extremely daunting. So don&rsquo;t. Stop trying to reinvent
the wheel and start improving it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to embrace the basic

sprout up once the wheels are moving. It&rsquo;s better to be producing than
deadlocked on what to produce.</p>

much to the beautiful corners of our web.</p><p>There were some great panel lineups and as much as I love hearing about tech and
code I felt like distancing myself from the technical aspects of our industry
and focus on listening to what others had to say about the roles psychology and
sociology play in what we do.</p><p>One of my favorites had to be Charles MacInerney&rsquo;s
(<a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&amp;amp;id=111060">http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&amp;amp;id=111060</a>)
discussion on How To Increase Creativity At Work. His overview of brain wave
frequencies, mind mapping, paradigm shifting and yoga techniques really opened
my eyes. I&rsquo;ve been practicing his breathing and stretching techniques and they
really do work!</p><p>Another panel that stuck with me was Kathy Sierra&rsquo;s
(<a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&amp;amp;id=103421">http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=bio&amp;amp;id=103421</a>)
presentation on Creating Passionate Users. Kathy summed it up best, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t
matter what people think about your brand, it&rsquo;s about how they think about
themselves.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m so intrigued about the human brain and this panel was icing on
the cake. I raced to the bookstore yesterday to buy Flow

and humble. It was so great met new people and experience Austin. My only regret

This
question seems to be rare yet extremely important in our decision making process.
This (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/</a>) book prompted my pondering
of this.</p><p>To clarify, temporal art includes poetry, writing, film and music. Plastic art
takes the form of painting, drawing and sculpture. What sets the two apart is
that fourth dimension, time. The success of temporal art is in its progressive
events leading up to a fulfilling end, better known as climax. This all makes
sense, right? So how do we classify interactive art?</p><p>My guess is it&rsquo;s both, however, I&rsquo;m leaning toward temporal. Unfortunately a lot
of times we design with a plastic mindset when we should be thinking about a
climactic ending. Should we be treating sites like small stories? Grab peoples
attention, pull them in, building them up, then smack them with an unforgettable
message. Very few do this. The non-linear aspect of this medium complicates the
time quality of temporal art.</p><p>So what is interactive art? Still pondering this one.</p>

wisly reminds Vinnie, &ldquo;never let anyone know what you are thinking.&rdquo;</p><p>The importance of this is astronomical in client meetings. Never bring new ideas
to the table in a client meeting. Bring vetted ideas. Prepare yourself before
the meeting. Have concept sessions with colleagues, visualize the ideas, make
sure you have the resources and be sure the idea is possible. When it comes time
to present save a few in your back pocket just in case you need some amo.</p><p>If the client latches on to a &ldquo;new idea&rdquo; then you take the risk of have to
execute it. If you realize later that it&rsquo;s not possible or a weak idea, too
late. Concepting is your job not the clients. If you transfer this power their
understanding of their role will forever be jaded. This can cause a world of
pain for you and them.</p>

pro choice so if you choose to abort I understand whole heartedly. Before you do
so please consider adoption, there are plenty of other good coders out there
that may benefit.</p><p>Ok, enough metaphors. This is some actionscript I did over Christmas (download
code (/code/flash_template.zip), see example (/code/flash_template/index.html)).
It&rsquo;s a flash framework for throwing together websites quickly. My main focus was
in and out transitions and the implementation of GDispatcher (<a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/000027.html)">http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/000027.html)</a>.
Keep in mind this was a first attempt at trying to shoehorn MVC into flash. You
may notice a similar directory structure to Rails (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">http://www.rubyonrails.com</a>),
thats just for my own sanity. I&rsquo;m working on a more refined version with a
clearer definition between Controllers and Views. I may post it for your
scrutiny later on.</p><p>Feedback is the purpose of this exercise. If it proves beneficial to me I&rsquo;ll
post more code. So SPEAK UP, I want to hear with you think, good or evil.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Looking back at this code, it&rsquo;s not as cool as I once thought. I&rsquo;ve
since re-factored it a lot so keep that in mind when you begin to judge. This
was my first attempt at using the Event Dispatch model so you might see some
spaghetti. However, it should be helpful to see how things are organized.</p>

anything too special but the resulting clarity and relaxation was well worth it.</p><p>This weekend I&rsquo;ll be cutting it a little short so I can be somewhat social

dark coffee house chugging away on my laptop.</p><p>Waking up the right hemisphere of my brain will be challenging but I have faith.
This week has been full of ActionScript and Rails left-ness. You may be asking
yourself, how does one flip from programming to design with ease? Well, one
doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s like luring a two year old away from a shinny piece of tin foil.
My formula consists of waking up early, relocating to someplace inspiring that

(<a href="http://www.bernstein-rein.com">http://www.bernstein-rein.com</a>). Like most ad agencies they focus primarily on
print and broadcast. Having a small web division can sometimes cause confusion
between the different mediums.</p><p>I never really realized how different web was from print and broadcast until my
time at an agency. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a quick list of a few items that I think set
web apart. I could go into more detail but for the sake of brevity I kept them
general and to the point.</p><ol><li><strong>Font Families</strong> When setting copy we&rsquo;re limited to a handful of fonts that
natively exist on peoples computers. This means your Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro
W6 is out of the question.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> Unfortunately type sucks on the web but it&rsquo;s getting better.
We use a programming language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define
the properties of typography. CSS has its advantages and limitations. These
limitations include no kerning and no word spacing. Sad but true.</li><li><strong>Programming</strong> To make that graphic fly across the screen requires an
understanding of math, physics and logic. In one way or another this holds
true for everything you see on the web. Code is the underlying support beams,
rivets, and concrete. It&rsquo;s the dirty part of the job that no one wants to
witness. More time goes into programming than any part of the job.</li><li><strong>Testing</strong> Imagine testing a new car design on 7 different types of roads.
Some roads are too thin, some are comfortably wide, some with speed bumps and
some that defy the laws of nature. This is similar to making sure a website
works in different browsers. This can be the most frustrating phase.</li><li><strong>Usability</strong> Web is more similar to product design than any other type of
design. If you&rsquo;re going to design a toaster you better be damn sure someone
knows where to put the toast. Easier said than done. This is where a majority
of web design fails. Art is for the wall, design provides solutions.</li><li><strong>Impermanent</strong> The web is a living thing. There is no such thing as a
permanent website. If you&rsquo;re waiting for perfection, stop, you won&rsquo;t find it.
If you go live with a design and you find a mistake, fix it. It&rsquo;s not like
finding a mistake after printing 50,000 copies.</li><li><strong>Audience</strong> If your site doesn&rsquo;t change frequently people won&rsquo;t come back.</li><li><strong>Traffic</strong> If you build it, they will NOT come. It&rsquo;s like building a store
in the middle of Kansas and expecting everyone to know about it. Bullshit!
Banners, search engine placement, word of mouth, and a good product will
bring you the audience you so desire.</li><li><strong>Copy</strong> People don&rsquo;t like reading while starring into a huge light bulb. The
message should be short, clear, and memorable. Much like the broadcast medium.
Only the die hards and those that don&rsquo;t suffer from ADD will read.</li><li><strong>72dpi</strong> No more no less. Deal with it.</li></ol><p>Sorry if this seems to be preaching to the choir but I felt the need to get this
out in the open.</p>

It didn&rsquo;t
carry much meaning other than playgrounds seemed like whimsical places where
imagination wondered. I feel I&rsquo;ve grown out of the name.</p><p>Playground Blues has meant a lot to me. It&rsquo;s enjoyed roughly five official
redesigns, god knows how many unofficial. It&rsquo;s been featured on many sites
including The Daily Report (<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot">http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot</a>) by

mentioned at the 2004 May 1st Reboot (<a href="http://www.may1reboot.com/2004)">http://www.may1reboot.com/2004)</a>.</p><p>I bid Playground Blues farewell as I introduce to you You Know Where You Are.
YKWYA represents me, now. The idea is simple,<strong>Real Content</strong>, which means
fresh links,<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/">photos</a>, audio, camera
feeds (/webcam) and experiments. My first experiment can literally be seen in
the upper right corner of the home page. I hope you enjoy this new direction as
it evolves. Always more to come!</p>
