whispering sweet nothings into innocent passerby&rsquo;s. You mock my town by cloaking
yourself in local establishments and yet you still survive. You&rsquo;re like a light

Wal-mart&rsquo;s ambitions but not you. You somehow slipped through the carpet cracks
and built your roach hotel right across from my work.</p>

        <p>I just bought a new nano and Nike+ kit but I didn&rsquo;t want the Nike shoes nor did

I decided to surgically insert the transmitter into my shoe tongue.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p>Gather up your favorite running shoe. Find an exacto knife or razor blade of

<p>Cut a slit about an inch in length into the backside of the shoe tongue. Try not
to cut all the way through to the other side.</p>

        <p>So back in the Fall of 2005 I launched (/posts/2005/aug/15/bejeweled/) my foray
into the world of Rails like every other designer wannabe programmer. I&rsquo;ll be
honest, I did it because everyone else was. Looking back I don&rsquo;t really know
why, I just followed the &ldquo;if it feels good, do it&rdquo; principle.</p>
<p>Out of that decision grew a love/hate relationship. I&rsquo;m primarily a designer but
I like sticking my hands in the programming cookie jar. I appreciate things that
just work, offering few opportunities for me to unknowingly screw something up.
Looking back, most of my time was spent developing admin tools, troubleshooting
500 errors, and deployment. For some reason I accepted this as the norm, and to
some degree, enjoyed it. It was like tinkering with a train set (no pun intended).
Until I saw a job posting (<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/26/designer-wanted/)">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/26/designer-wanted/)</a>.</p>
<p>World Online was seeking a senior designer to lead its commercial projects. I
was interested but it meant no more Rails and I&rsquo;d have to gain a fundamental
understanding of Django, a Python web development framework. This intrigued me.
I remember hearing whispers of Django at SXSW in March. I knew there was no way
I could seriously apply for the job if I didn&rsquo;t believe in Django as I did Rails.</p>
<p>After two weeks and with the aid of some great online documentation, I released
(/posts/2006/jun/26/80x80/) a new personal site. I was sold, and not just
because there was a carrot dangling in-front of me. Realizing I would never have
to make another admin tool allowed me the exhale and start dreaming up better
designs, info-graphics, API usages, and relationships between content. Django
was an instrument that, with little instruction, I could enjoy playing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been little over a month and I&rsquo;m still playing. So far, Django has kept a
steady beat. No more 500 errors, no more building admin tools, and it&rsquo;s freakin
fast. It should be noted that I have no ill feelings towards Rails. It&rsquo;s a great
framework but the benefits Django offer me, as a designer, are just too great.
Plus I took the job so I have to use it :)</p>
<p>For those of you wanting to make a similar switch, I encourage it. Here are some
resources that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django overview (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/overview/">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/overview/</a>)</li>
<li>Writing your first Django app (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial1/">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial1/</a>)</li>
<li>Django for non-programmers (<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/02/django-non-programmers/">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/02/django-non-programmers/</a>)</li>
<li>Are you generic? (<a href="http://www.wilsonminer.com/posts/2006/may/10/are-you-generic/">http://www.wilsonminer.com/posts/2006/may/10/are-you-generic/</a>)</li>
<li>Setting up Django on Dreamhost (<a href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/11/django-dreamhost/">http://www2.jeffcroft.com/2006/may/11/django-dreamhost/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Django community is very welcoming. The online documentation is well written
and oddly fun to read. I gained a lot from looking at the actual Django website
code (<a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/djangoproject.com/django_website">http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/djangoproject.com/django_website</a>)
and listening in the irc channel (#django). It&rsquo;s also worth reading the philosophy
(<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/design_philosophies/">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/design_philosophies/</a>) behind Django.</p>
<p>The popular decision isn&rsquo;t always the right one. This is pretty obvious to most.
I think Django Reinhardt said it best, &ldquo;Jazz attracted me because in it I found
a formal perfection and instrumental precision that I admire in classical music,
but which popular music doesn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; I believe Django (framework) lives up to
this perfection and precision Mr. Reinhardt speaks of.</p>

        <p>So how easy is it to yank out all links in a post and display them as a list on
their own? Well with a little Python love and some Django filters it&rsquo;s easy as
microwave burritos. Before we get started you&rsquo;ll need a fresh copy of
ElementTree and BeautifulSoup.</p>
<p>ElementTree (<a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm</a>) and BeautifulSoup
(<a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/</a>) together form a very handy
toolbox for parsing structured data. ElementTree is used a lot for parsing XML
and BeautifulSoup is tailored more towards parsing XHTML. Download both of these
guys and drop them in your python path so they can be accessed within your
Django app.</p>
<p>Once those guys are seated you can then write a very simple templatetag filter.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#a6e22e">@register</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>filter
<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">get_links</span>(value):
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">try</span>:
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">try</span>:
<span style="color:#f92672">from</span> BeautifulSoup <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> BeautifulSoup
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">except</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">ImportError</span>:
<span style="color:#f92672">from</span> beautifulsoup <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> BeautifulSoup
    soup <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> BeautifulSoup(value)
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> soup<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>findAll(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;a&#39;</span>)
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">except</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">ImportError</span>:
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> settings<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>DEBUG:
<span style="color:#66d9ef">raise</span> template<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>TemplateSyntaxError, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Error in &#39;get_links&#39; filter: BeautifulSoup isn&#39;t installed.&#34;</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> value
</code></pre></div><p>Save that into your templattags directory and use it like so in a template:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">ul</span>&gt;
  {% for link in object.body|getlinks %}
  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">li</span>&gt;&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">a</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{{ link.href }}&#34;</span>&gt;{{ link.title }}&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">li</span>&gt;
  {% endfor %}
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">ul</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The above example assumes you&rsquo;re working with an object that has a field called
body which contains simple HTML structured data. The next assumption is that
each anchor has a title attribute. If you didn&rsquo;t want to mess with titles, just
say {{ link }} instead. For more on templatetags consume some tasty Django
Documentation (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#extending-the-template-system)">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#extending-the-template-system)</a>.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>UPDATE: I may have inadvertently implied that you needed ElementTree to use
BeautifulSoup. This is in fact wrong. BeautifulSoup can play by itself.</p>

        <p>Context can be described as, &ldquo;the circumstances that form the setting for an
event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and
assessed.&rdquo; Context plays an important role in communication and I&rsquo;d like start
by providing better context to posts.</p>
<p>You may have noticed a left column on my blog post pages. It now contains geo
location information regarding where the post was written, categories it belongs
to, links that exist within the post and photos that were taken on the day the
it was published.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-all-this-mean">What does all this mean?</h1>
<p>The goal is to give posts an added level of meaning. In some instances I&rsquo;ve
noticed a correlation between photos
(<a href="http://www.domaki.com/posts/2006/jul/10/its-time-behave/">http://www.domaki.com/posts/2006/jul/10/its-time-behave/</a>) and what I decided to
write or maybe a location (<a href="http://www.domaki.com/posts/2005/sep/24/innocent-bystander/">http://www.domaki.com/posts/2005/sep/24/innocent-bystander/</a>)
inspired a post. Sometimes it may not be as apparent but, if anything, it brings
a little more life to information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on adding photos that correlate to the location pages once I have
time to play with the new geo data (<a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/geotagging_one_.html">http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/geotagging_one_.html</a>)
in Flickr. I&rsquo;d love to see other examples of this practice. Suggestions are
always welcome.</p>

        <p>Always tweaking here and there. Today marks a big tweak including a name change,
site realignment, and a fun little visualization project. Welcome to Domaki
(pronounced DuÂ·mockÂ·eee), formerly &ldquo;You know where you are&rdquo; and
formally &ldquo;Playground Blues.&rdquo; I am your host, Nathan Borror.</p>
<h1 id="whats-changed">Whats changed?</h1>
<p>All the markup has been overhauled. I&rsquo;ve been fine tuning a particular CSS
framework that is a derivative of the YUI framework (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/</a>)
over at Yahoo. Dimensions are based on percentages and em&rsquo;s which allow the
interface to scaled up, down, out or in. It also makes it very easy to achieve
liquid layouts. The back end is still Django with very little changes. (Beware
IE users, still flushing out some annoying bugs.)</p>
<h1 id="tumbling">Tumbling</h1>
<p>I added a &ldquo;tumblelog&rdquo; using some of Jacob&rsquo;s (<a href="http://www.jacobian.org/">http://www.jacobian.org/</a>) code.
It&rsquo;s visible on the homepage. This basically gathers all my photos, bookmarks,
comments and even webcam freezes and spits them out at once. Over the weekend I
threw together a visualization using Flash which can be viewed (<a href="http://www.domaki.com/labs/)">http://www.domaki.com/labs/)</a>.
It should be fun to see what other visualizations I can dream up.</p>
<h1 id="webcam-freeze">Webcam Freeze</h1>
<p>The webcam (<a href="http://www.domaki.com/webcam/">http://www.domaki.com/webcam/</a>) is back! I&rsquo;ve retooled the layout
and it should be easy as pie to freeze a moment of my time and attach a comment
to it. All the old freezes are back up too. I still think this is pretty unique.
I&rsquo;d be interested to know if anyone else has spied something similar.</p>
<h1 id="so-why-the-name-change">So why the name change?</h1>
<p>I wanted something short and simple. I didn&rsquo;t like &lsquo;Playground Blues&rsquo; because it
had a color in the name which seemed kind of cheesy. I liked &lsquo;You know where you
are&rsquo; but got tired of typing it. While staring at my bulletin board one day I
noticed this little character (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/223203462/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/223203462/</a>)
with the name &lsquo;dodo maki.&rsquo; It sounded goofy and interesting. I reduced it to six
letters and bought the domain (btw: available six letter domains are becoming
pretty rare these days). It doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of meaning now but thats the
beauty of new brands, over time it&rsquo;s meaning will grow and some day, who knows,
it might be added to Websters :)</p>

        <p>In the 20&rsquo;s we fought prohibition, 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s it was segregation. Today we
face a new battle called privacy. I bring this up because in todays Lawrence
Journal-World Sarah Benson wrote an interesting article titled Facebook
indiscretions plague users (<a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/)">http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/)</a>.</p>
<p>In her article she gives two examples of the unintended consequences of social
networking. The first outlines how an employer can peer into prospective
employees social pasts using current employee accounts. The second explains how
a group of students, toasting to the university alcohol policy in the comforts
of their dorm, got caught by university officials discovering photos in a users
profile.</p>
<p>This is somewhat frightening in a Flickr, MySpace, Friendster, Facebook, Google,
Del.icio.us world. With ease I can pick a person discover last nights party pics,
a detailed description of what movies, music, and body type they are, what
searches they performed last night and what websites they felt worthy of
remembering. This may seem harmless but when aggregated, opinions form, and
worse yet form out of context.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem sharing my photos (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/)">http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/)</a>,
bookmarks (<a href="http://del.icio.us/sketch22/)">http://del.icio.us/sketch22/)</a>, and even precious thoughts
(<a href="http://www.youknowwhereyouare.com/posts/)">http://www.youknowwhereyouare.com/posts/)</a>. I do worry that those who don&rsquo;t know
me well may take them out of context. While privacy is societies hurdle in the
coming years I think we as individuals need to be reminded of the importance of
context.</p>
