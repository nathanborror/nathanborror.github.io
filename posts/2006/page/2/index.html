<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/damn-you-starbucks/>Damn you Starbucks</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, September 22, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I despise you and your cranberry oatmeal mountain bars and tall house coffees with room for cream. Your sirens (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks#Name_and_logo) whispering sweet nothings into innocent passerby&rsquo;s. You mock my town by cloaking yourself in local establishments and yet you still survive. You&rsquo;re like a light brown german cockroach impervious to insecticide. My town successfully squashed Wal-mart&rsquo;s ambitions but not you. You somehow slipped through the carpet cracks and built your roach hotel right across from my work.</p>

<p>I just bought a new nano and Nike+ kit but I didn&rsquo;t want the Nike shoes nor did I care for the recent &lsquo;velcro&rsquo; hack. Instead of looking like a huge geek with a transmitter in my laces (http://podophile.com/2006/07/14/shoe-hacker-nikeipod-sport-kit-shoe-mod/), I decided to surgically insert the transmitter into my shoe tongue.
Step 1 Gather up your favorite running shoe. Find an exacto knife or razor blade of sorts and buy a Nike+ kit.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/nostalgic-four-years/>Nostalgic four years</a></h2>
<h3>Thursday, September 14, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Last night I was doing a little house cleaning and drifted off to reminiscing mode. I didn&rsquo;t realize how many redesigns I&rsquo;ve gone through and the ones that never made the cut. In some cases I kinda wish they did. So as a follow up to &ldquo;Slightly neurotic on change&rdquo; (/posts/2006/sep/04/slightly-neurotic-change/) I&rsquo;ll prove this neurosis with the following dusty relics from the past:

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/switching-rails-django/>Switching from Rails to Django</a></h2>
<h3>Monday, September 11, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>So back in the Fall of 2005 I launched (/posts/2005/aug/15/bejeweled/) my foray into the world of Rails like every other designer wannabe programmer. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I did it because everyone else was. Looking back I don&rsquo;t really know why, I just followed the &ldquo;if it feels good, do it&rdquo; principle.
Out of that decision grew a love/hate relationship. I&rsquo;m primarily a designer but I like sticking my hands in the programming cookie jar.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/fun-beautiful-soup/>Fun with Beautiful Soup</a></h2>
<h3>Saturday, September 9, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>So how easy is it to yank out all links in a post and display them as a list on their own? Well with a little Python love and some Django filters it&rsquo;s easy as microwave burritos. Before we get started you&rsquo;ll need a fresh copy of ElementTree and BeautifulSoup.
ElementTree (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm) and BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) together form a very handy toolbox for parsing structured data. ElementTree is used a lot for parsing XML and BeautifulSoup is tailored more towards parsing XHTML.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/warming-context/>Warming up to context</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, September 8, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Context can be described as, &ldquo;the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed.&rdquo; Context plays an important role in communication and I&rsquo;d like start by providing better context to posts.
You may have noticed a left column on my blog post pages. It now contains geo location information regarding where the post was written, categories it belongs to, links that exist within the post and photos that were taken on the day the it was published.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>Always tweaking here and there. Today marks a big tweak including a name change, site realignment, and a fun little visualization project. Welcome to Domaki (pronounced Du·mock·eee), formerly &ldquo;You know where you are&rdquo; and formally &ldquo;Playground Blues.&rdquo; I am your host, Nathan Borror.
Whats changed? All the markup has been overhauled. I&rsquo;ve been fine tuning a particular CSS framework that is a derivative of the YUI framework (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/) over at Yahoo.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/privacy-context/>Privacy in context</a></h2>
<h3>Saturday, August 12, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>In the 20&rsquo;s we fought prohibition, 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s it was segregation. Today we face a new battle called privacy. I bring this up because in todays Lawrence Journal-World Sarah Benson wrote an interesting article titled Facebook indiscretions plague users (http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/).
In her article she gives two examples of the unintended consequences of social networking. The first outlines how an employer can peer into prospective employees social pasts using current employee accounts.</p>

<h3>Tuesday, August 8, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>The reviews (http://www.wired.com/news/columns/cultofmac/0,71557-0.html?tw=wn_technology_4) are pouring (http://www.mcelhearn.com/article.php?story=20060808113448585) in regarding this years WWDC keynote. Each critiquing the slightest moves Steve Jobs made or didn&rsquo;t make. This shared keynote in particular has raised the question, &ldquo;is Jobs preparing for departure?&rdquo; Just the notion spreads fear amongst even the most liberal mac fanatics.
This got me thinking about the importance of hiring the right people. Wikipedia defines company (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company) as a &ldquo;legal entity formed which has a separate legal identity from its members.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/white-flight-takes/>White Flight takes off</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, August 8, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Holly fucking shit you have to listen to White Flight (http://rangeliferecords.com/listen/listen_WF_02.html) right now! Yesterday I stepped into my boss&rsquo;s very slick auto to pick up some pies for a late night work dinner and I expect some NPR, instead I get a feeling I got the first time I heard Postal Service.
Not since my Postal Service experience have I heard music of this caliber. Justin Roelofs (http://www.lawrence.com/blogs/street_level/2005/dec/09/hownow/), from The Anniversary, has managed to enter a realm that has no explanation.</p>
