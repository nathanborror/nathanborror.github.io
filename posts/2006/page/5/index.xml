        <p>Thank God it&rsquo;s Friday. I&rsquo;m planning another one of my &ldquo;introvert retreats.&rdquo;
About two weeks ago at 5 o&rsquo;clock CST I turned off all forms of communication.
The following day I drove to Lawrence, Kansas sans laptop. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like
anything too special but the resulting clarity and relaxation was well worth it.</p>
<p>This weekend I&rsquo;ll be cutting it a little short so I can be somewhat social
Saturday night. The trip to Lawrence is a go and I&rsquo;ll be invading an undisclosed
dark coffee house chugging away on my laptop.</p>
<p>Waking up the right hemisphere of my brain will be challenging but I have faith.
This week has been full of ActionScript and Rails left-ness. You may be asking
yourself, how does one flip from programming to design with ease? Well, one
doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s like luring a two year old away from a shinny piece of tin foil.
My formula consists of waking up early, relocating to someplace inspiring that
serves legally addictive stimulants, maybe reading some poetry or thumbing
through art books and, of course, great music. Here&rsquo;s a taste of my upcoming
brew:</p>

        <p>I work with a small team of designers inside a very large ad agency
(<a href="http://www.bernstein-rein.com">http://www.bernstein-rein.com</a>). Like most ad agencies they focus primarily on
print and broadcast. Having a small web division can sometimes cause confusion
between the different mediums.</p>
<p>I never really realized how different web was from print and broadcast until my
time at an agency. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a quick list of a few items that I think set
web apart. I could go into more detail but for the sake of brevity I kept them
general and to the point.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Font Families</strong> When setting copy we&rsquo;re limited to a handful of fonts that
natively exist on peoples computers. This means your Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro
W6 is out of the question.</li>
<li><strong>Typography</strong> Unfortunately type sucks on the web but it&rsquo;s getting better.
We use a programming language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define
the properties of typography. CSS has its advantages and limitations. These
limitations include no kerning and no word spacing. Sad but true.</li>
<li><strong>Programming</strong> To make that graphic fly across the screen requires an
understanding of math, physics and logic. In one way or another this holds
true for everything you see on the web. Code is the underlying support beams,
rivets, and concrete. It&rsquo;s the dirty part of the job that no one wants to
witness. More time goes into programming than any part of the job.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> Imagine testing a new car design on 7 different types of roads.
Some roads are too thin, some are comfortably wide, some with speed bumps and
some that defy the laws of nature. This is similar to making sure a website
works in different browsers. This can be the most frustrating phase.</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong> Web is more similar to product design than any other type of
design. If you&rsquo;re going to design a toaster you better be damn sure someone
knows where to put the toast. Easier said than done. This is where a majority
of web design fails. Art is for the wall, design provides solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Impermanent</strong> The web is a living thing. There is no such thing as a
permanent website. If you&rsquo;re waiting for perfection, stop, you won&rsquo;t find it.
If you go live with a design and you find a mistake, fix it. It&rsquo;s not like
finding a mistake after printing 50,000 copies.</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong> If your site doesn&rsquo;t change frequently people won&rsquo;t come back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> If you build it, they will NOT come. It&rsquo;s like building a store
in the middle of Kansas and expecting everyone to know about it. Bullshit!
Banners, search engine placement, word of mouth, and a good product will
bring you the audience you so desire.</li>
<li><strong>Copy</strong> People don&rsquo;t like reading while starring into a huge light bulb. The
message should be short, clear, and memorable. Much like the broadcast medium.
Only the die hards and those that don&rsquo;t suffer from ADD will read.</li>
<li><strong>72dpi</strong> No more no less. Deal with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry if this seems to be preaching to the choir but I felt the need to get this
out in the open.</p>

        <p>When the name Playground Blues was chosen I was a junior in college. It didn&rsquo;t
carry much meaning other than playgrounds seemed like whimsical places where
imagination wondered. I feel I&rsquo;ve grown out of the name.</p>
<p>Playground Blues has meant a lot to me. It&rsquo;s enjoyed roughly five official
redesigns, god knows how many unofficial. It&rsquo;s been featured on many sites
including The Daily Report (<a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot">http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot</a>) by
Jeffrey Zeldman, Moluv (<a href="http://www.moluv.com/fsa.asp?startingPoint=197)">http://www.moluv.com/fsa.asp?startingPoint=197)</a>, CSS
Vault (<a href="http://cssvault.com/redesigned/playground_blues.php)">http://cssvault.com/redesigned/playground_blues.php)</a>, Stylegala
(<a href="http://www.stylegala.com/archive/playground_blues.htm)">http://www.stylegala.com/archive/playground_blues.htm)</a>, and was honorably
mentioned at the 2004 May 1st Reboot (<a href="http://www.may1reboot.com/2004)">http://www.may1reboot.com/2004)</a>.</p>
<p>I bid Playground Blues farewell as I introduce to you You Know Where You Are.
YKWYA represents me, now. The idea is simple, <strong>Real Content</strong>, which means
fresh links, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/">photos</a>, audio, camera
feeds (/webcam) and experiments. My first experiment can literally be seen in
the upper right corner of the home page. I hope you enjoy this new direction as
it evolves. Always more to come!</p>

        <p>The new and improved webcam (<a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com/webcam">http://www.playgroundblues.com/webcam</a>) is BACK! It
now allows you to post messages. When you do it attaches the current image and
keeps a running archive of past webcam moments. It&rsquo;s quite possible this is a
first in web history.  Could I be so lucky?</p>
<p>For those of you who were wondering&hellip; Evocam (<a href="http://www.evological.com/evocam.html">http://www.evological.com/evocam.html</a>)
is being used to FTP images every 30 seconds. Some handy flash work is being
used to serve the newest image to my people. Rails (<a href="http://www.playgroundblues.com">http://www.playgroundblues.com</a>)
is being used to take comments and associate the current photo with the comment.
Enough nerd speak, check it out, leave a comment.</p>
