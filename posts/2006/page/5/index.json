I\u0026rsquo;m planning another one of my \u0026ldquo;introvert retreats.\u0026rdquo;\nAbout two weeks ago at 5 o\u0026rsquo;clock CST I turned off all forms of communication.\nThe following day I drove to Lawrence, Kansas sans laptop. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like\nanything too special but the resulting clarity and relaxation was well worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weekend I\u0026rsquo;ll be cutting it a little short so I can be somewhat social\nSaturday night.

You may be asking\nyourself, how does one flip from programming to design with ease? Well, one\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s like luring a two year old away from a shinny piece of tin foil.\nMy formula consists of waking up early, relocating to someplace inspiring that\nserves legally addictive stimulants, maybe reading some poetry or thumbing\nthrough art books and, of course, great music.

Like most ad agencies they focus primarily on print and broadcast. Having a small web division can sometimes cause confusion between the different mediums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never really realized how different web was from print and broadcast until my time at an agency. So I\u0026rsquo;ve compiled a quick list of a few items that I think set web apart. I could go into more detail but for the sake of brevity I kept them general and to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFont Families\u003c/strong\u003e When setting copy we\u0026rsquo;re limited to a handful of fonts that natively exist on peoples computers.

We use a programming language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the properties of typography. CSS has its advantages and limitations. These limitations include no kerning and no word spacing. Sad but true.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProgramming\u003c/strong\u003e To make that graphic fly across the screen requires an understanding of math, physics and logic. In one way or another this holds true for everything you see on the web. Code is the underlying support beams, rivets, and concrete. It\u0026rsquo;s the dirty part of the job that no one wants to witness. More time goes into programming than any part of the job.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTesting\u003c/strong\u003e Imagine testing a new car design on 7 different types of roads. Some roads are too thin, some are comfortably wide, some with speed bumps and some that defy the laws of nature. This is similar to making sure a website works in different browsers. This can be the most frustrating phase.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsability\u003c/strong\u003e Web is more similar to product design than any other type of design. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to design a toaster you better be damn sure someone knows where to put the toast. Easier said than done. This is where a majority of web design fails. Art is for the wall, design provides solutions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImpermanent\u003c/strong\u003e The web is a living thing. There is no such thing as a permanent website. If you\u0026rsquo;re waiting for perfection, stop, you won\u0026rsquo;t find it. If you go live with a design and you find a mistake, fix it. It\u0026rsquo;s not like finding a mistake after printing 50,000 copies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudience\u003c/strong\u003e If your site doesn\u0026rsquo;t change frequently people won\u0026rsquo;t come back.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTraffic\u003c/strong\u003e If you build it, they will NOT come. It\u0026rsquo;s like building a store in the middle of Kansas and expecting everyone to know about it. Bullshit!
