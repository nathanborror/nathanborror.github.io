<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/making-case/>Making The Case</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, April 25, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Why is it that certain days I opt for the Man&rsquo;s coffee and other days I champion the locals? I thought it had something to do with consistency but that&rsquo;s bullshit. While the Man&rsquo;s store is well designed and has a familiar atmosphere it reeks of fake smiles, stale business folk, and overly perfect pastries. Admittedly those dainty pastries are quite wonderful, but thats besides the point.
The locals aren&rsquo;t afraid to show attitude, they&rsquo;re real, they proudly bear the title, Barista.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/dont-stress/>Don't Stress</a></h2>
<h3>Saturday, April 22, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Your heart starts pounding, blood pressure soars and you begin to take shorter faster breaths. Why do we put every cell in our body through such a traumatic experience?
Stress was hard wired into our bodies for those face to face moments with mountain lions. It&rsquo;s called fight or flight. Mountain lions don&rsquo;t seem to bother us anymore so we&rsquo;ve repurposed this reaction to things like client deadlines, idiots on the freeway, and that bar that plays horrible music on wednesday nights below my loft.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/dont-delete-version/>Don't Delete, Version</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, April 19, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of versioning. And I don&rsquo;t mean versioning in the programming sense, although I really need to figure out Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) one of these days. I&rsquo;m referring to content management systems.
I don&rsquo;t know why but deletion just bugs me. Maybe its my pack rat mentality but to delete is to lose. I write blog entries all the time that don&rsquo;t get published and sometimes I completely rewrite them losing past versions.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/rules-rule/>Rules Rule</a></h2>
<h3>Monday, April 17, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>As children we grew up hating curfew, as adolescence we rebelled against the drinking age, and as adults we shake our fists at stop lights and speed limits. What we don&rsquo;t realize is rules set us free.
I came across this simple notion in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&rsquo;s book Flow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/). By having laws and rules we free ourselves from contemplating things that have already been determined. This provides a framework for thought which is valuable when applied to design.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/my-easter/>My Easter</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, April 16, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Woke up around 11:30 after a long night of coding (http://www.rubyonrails.com). Had a turkey sandwich and some pretzels while watching some television (http://www.historychannel.com). Packed up some essentials: laptop (http://www.apple.com/powerbook/), couple (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/) books (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024114/), and headphones (http://www.stanc.net/eggo/). Drove to the cafe (http://www.broadwaycafeandroastery.com) that breaks for no resurrection. Had a soy latte while improving some Rails code and listening to some music (http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=2960659&amp;amp;s=143441). Then I came home, worked out, read (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007655/), and listened to some piano.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/jason-collett/>Jason Collett</a></h2>
<h3>Thursday, April 6, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Just got back from a session with Jason Collett (http://www.arts-crafts.ca/jasoncollett/) from Broken Social Scene (http://www.arts-crafts.ca/bss/). I highly recommend checking this man out. Has sort of a modern day Bob Dylan appeal with fresh percussion. Their newest album, Idols of Exile, offers quaint morsels of Canadian goodness. If you&rsquo;re in need of something fresh and lighthearted, look no further. I only wish Mrs. Feist could have made an appearance.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/after-sxsw/>After SXSW</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, March 14, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I already miss waking up in the morning and planning my day at the Hide Out over a cup of joe. I miss that walk from 7th and Congress to the convention center seeing fellow lanyards. More importantly I miss seeing those who contribute so much to the beautiful corners of our web.
There were some great panel lineups and as much as I love hearing about tech and code I felt like distancing myself from the technical aspects of our industry and focus on listening to what others had to say about the roles psychology and sociology play in what we do.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2006/gooey-plastic/>Gooey Plastic</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, March 5, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>At what point does interactive design become temporal art over plastic art? This question seems to be rare yet extremely important in our decision making process. This (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/) book prompted my pondering of this.
To clarify, temporal art includes poetry, writing, film and music. Plastic art takes the form of painting, drawing and sculpture. What sets the two apart is that fourth dimension, time. The success of temporal art is in its progressive events leading up to a fulfilling end, better known as climax.</p>

<h3>Saturday, March 4, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>One of my favorite quotes from the Godfather trillogy is when Michael Corleone wisly reminds Vinnie, &ldquo;never let anyone know what you are thinking.&rdquo;
The importance of this is astronomical in client meetings. Never bring new ideas to the table in a client meeting. Bring vetted ideas. Prepare yourself before the meeting. Have concept sessions with colleagues, visualize the ideas, make sure you have the resources and be sure the idea is possible.</p>

<h3>Monday, February 27, 2006</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Bored tonight so I thought I&rsquo;d impregnate some coders out there with some of my seed. My hopes are that this will cause you to give birth to better code. I am pro choice so if you choose to abort I understand whole heartedly. Before you do so please consider adoption, there are plenty of other good coders out there that may benefit.
Ok, enough metaphors. This is some actionscript I did over Christmas (download code (/code/flash_template.</p>
