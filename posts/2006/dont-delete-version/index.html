<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of versioning. And I don&rsquo;t mean versioning
in the programming sense, although I really need to figure out Subversion
(<a href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>) one of these days. I&rsquo;m referring to content
management systems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but deletion just bugs me. Maybe its my pack rat mentality but
to delete is to lose. I write blog entries all the time that don&rsquo;t get published
and sometimes I completely rewrite them losing past versions. This seems more
important in CMS&rsquo;s where content evolves and sometimes needs to be step back.
From what I&rsquo;ve experienced this isn&rsquo;t easy, or even an option in most cases.</p>
<p>Is this a needed feature? Wiki&rsquo;s (<a href=http://www.wiki.org/>http://www.wiki.org/</a>) do a fantastic job of
this. Writeboards (<a href=http://www.writeboard.com/>http://www.writeboard.com/</a>) by 37Signals (<a href=http://www.37signals.com>http://www.37signals.com</a>)
are a great example (love the compare feature). But how often do you see a site
managed by a Wiki or a Writeboard? I&rsquo;d like to know your thoughts.</p>
