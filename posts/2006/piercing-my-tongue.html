# Piercing my tongue

I just bought a new nano and Nike+ kit but I didn't want the Nike shoes nor did I care for the recent 'velcro' hack. Instead of looking like a huge geek with a [transmitter in my laces](http://podophile.com/2006/07/14/shoe-hacker-nikeipod-sport-kit-shoe-mod/), I decided to surgically insert the transmitter into my shoe tongue.

## Step 1

Gather up your favorite running shoe. Find an exacto knife or razor blade of sorts and buy a Nike+ kit.

## Step 2
Loosen up your strings and stick out your tongue.

## Step 3
Cut a slit about an inch in length into the backside of the shoe tongue. Try not to cut all the way through to the other side.

## Step 4
Slip in the Nike+ transmitter and push it down into the tongue.

Congratulations! Your ready to run in your favorite pair of shoes.
