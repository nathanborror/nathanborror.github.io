# Damn you Starbucks

I despise you and your cranberry oatmeal mountain bars and tall house coffees with room for cream. Your [sirens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks#Name_and_logo) whispering sweet nothings into innocent passerby's. You mock my town by cloaking yourself in local establishments and yet you still survive. You're like a light brown german cockroach impervious to insecticide. My town successfully squashed Wal-mart's ambitions but not you. You somehow slipped through the carpet cracks and built your roach hotel right across from my work.

**DAMN YOU!**

_I love you._
