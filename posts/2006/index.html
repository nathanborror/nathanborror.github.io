<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/a-look-back/>A look back</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, December 31, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Two thousand six was full of spontaneous moments with great friends and coworkers. It also had some noteworthy, personal milestones that I thought I&rsquo;d highlight before the clock strikes twelve.
January / February saw the launch of Authentic Films (http://www.authenticfilms.net). It was my first official jump into the world of Actionscript and thanks to Travis (http://www.podlob.com) the water wasn&rsquo;t that cold.
March / April involved traveling to Austin, Texas where I attended my first SXSW conference (http://flickr.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/rip-print/>RIP Print</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, December 11, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Print is about to die and we better prepare ourselves. I was doing some christmas shopping last week and stumbled into a Sony Style story. I&rsquo;m not a fan of the Sony brand but they do seem to come out with some daring devices. The first thing that struck me was the Sony Reader (http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/).
The Sony Reader is basically a very thin screen that uses E-Ink technology (http://eink.com/) to display text and basic graphics.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/i-dont-like/>I don't like</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, December 2, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve consistently heard various permutations of two phrases, &ldquo;I like&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Throw away, easy phrases. I&rsquo;ve never valued the first and I&rsquo;ve had nothing but contempt for the second.
My professor in college would dock our grades when someone uttered one of these phrases. He believed they were lame and comfortable. If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to say, you didn&rsquo;t really have anything to say.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/the-future-role-of-libraries/>The Future Role of Libraries</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, November 20, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>If Libraries want to stay relevant they have to redefine their role in communities. The common perception is they have books, lots of books. This is obvious. Over the last decade the perception has grown to include internet access. However, this isn&rsquo;t enough to survive. If you live in a progressive town like myself, WiFi is ubiquitous. When the Library is competing with Henry&rsquo;s Coffeehouse, well, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you who wins.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/an-open-answer/>An Open answer</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, November 7, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>It&rsquo;s my prediction that over the next few years we&rsquo;re going to see a rise of localized social networks/directories. Localized social networks can augment and enhance real world local communities, if the recipe is just right. The first ingredient is key for any up-and-comming project summoning user authentication.
The key to localized networks and other new applications that fill particular niches is OpenID (http://openid.net/). Consistency among user profiles is non-existant. OpenID brings with it a pure, centralized repository for profile management where you&rsquo;re empowered to adjust the strings of privacy based on sites you&rsquo;ve opened the doors too.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/elections-by-the-seat-of-our-chads/>Elections by the seat of our chads</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, November 7, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve launched a lot of web projects in my career, but none of them have come close to the excitement of this evenings whirlwind. For the 2006 elections our little group called World Online at the Lawrence Journal-World launched a live view of the local and state citizens fulfilling their democratic roles as citizens.
At 7pm CST we flipped the switch, waiting patiently while live data feeds poured in from Associated Press, Kansas Secretary of State and Douglas County.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/in-with-the-ems-and-percentages/>In with the Em's and Percentages</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, November 1, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>For the past few projects I&rsquo;ve thrown out all use of pixels and relied heavily on an em&rsquo;s and percentages for layout and font sizing. Why would someone take such drastic measures? Two simple reasons: usability and flexibility.
The current Domaki, circa Fall 2006, uses this practice which makes the liquid layout possible with ease. A non-liquid example would be the Ellington (http://www.ellingtoncms.com) site which uses a container set in EM&rsquo;s with all inner layers set to percentages.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/a-gestalt-point-of-view/>A Gestalt point of view</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, October 24, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>During my junior year of college I was required to enroll in a cinematography course as part of the Electronic Arts program. The first day of class we received a typical syllabus and course schedule. Then we immediately dove into a topic that I still remember to this day, Gestalt psychology.
In its basic form, Gestalt tries to explain how we perceive more than the collected sum. Musical tunes can be recognized in different keys or with added notes.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/ftp-bad-versioning-good/>FTP bad, versioning good</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, October 4, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>You may have noticed a little downtime Sunday evening. I was able to get the Domaki code under version control (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) which I highly recommend. It allows you to kick FTP to the curb and do everything with &ldquo;svn commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; commands.
The main reason for doing this was my extreme inability to remember which files I&rsquo;ve changed. Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/) takes the worry out of my day by committing the necessary files from my local machine to my repository.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/journalists-and-public-discourse/>Journalists and public discourse</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, September 29, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I was involved in a discussion recently about whether journalists should be allowed to comment on news stories. My employer, the Lawrence Journal-World, allows the public to comment on online stories. Quick note: while I may work for the newspaper my experience with journalism at the time of this post is very informal. I am a member of the public, which in my opinion makes this opinion just as valid as any.</p>
