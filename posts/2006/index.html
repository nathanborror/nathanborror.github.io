<h4>Sunday, December 31, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Two thousand six was full of spontaneous moments with great friends and coworkers. It also had some noteworthy, personal milestones that I thought I&rsquo;d highlight before the clock strikes twelve.
January / February saw the launch of Authentic Films (http://www.authenticfilms.net). It was my first official jump into the world of Actionscript and thanks to Travis (http://www.podlob.com) the water wasn&rsquo;t that cold.
March / April involved traveling to Austin, Texas where I attended my first SXSW conference (http://flickr.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/rip-print/>RIP Print</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, December 11, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Print is about to die and we better prepare ourselves. I was doing some christmas shopping last week and stumbled into a Sony Style story. I&rsquo;m not a fan of the Sony brand but they do seem to come out with some daring devices. The first thing that struck me was the Sony Reader (http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/).
The Sony Reader is basically a very thin screen that uses E-Ink technology (http://eink.com/) to display text and basic graphics.</p>

<h4>Saturday, December 2, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve consistently heard various permutations of two phrases, &ldquo;I like&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Throw away, easy phrases. I&rsquo;ve never valued the first and I&rsquo;ve had nothing but contempt for the second.
My professor in college would dock our grades when someone uttered one of these phrases. He believed they were lame and comfortable. If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to say, you didn&rsquo;t really have anything to say.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/the-future-role-of-libraries/>The Future Role of Libraries</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, November 20, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>If Libraries want to stay relevant they have to redefine their role in communities. The common perception is they have books, lots of books. This is obvious. Over the last decade the perception has grown to include internet access. However, this isn&rsquo;t enough to survive. If you live in a progressive town like myself, WiFi is ubiquitous. When the Library is competing with Henry&rsquo;s Coffeehouse, well, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you who wins.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/an-open-answer/>An Open answer</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, November 7, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>It&rsquo;s my prediction that over the next few years we&rsquo;re going to see a rise of localized social networks/directories. Localized social networks can augment and enhance real world local communities, if the recipe is just right. The first ingredient is key for any up-and-comming project summoning user authentication.
The key to localized networks and other new applications that fill particular niches is OpenID (http://openid.net/). Consistency among user profiles is non-existant. OpenID brings with it a pure, centralized repository for profile management where you&rsquo;re empowered to adjust the strings of privacy based on sites you&rsquo;ve opened the doors too.</p>

<h4>Tuesday, November 7, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve launched a lot of web projects in my career, but none of them have come close to the excitement of this evenings whirlwind. For the 2006 elections our little group called World Online at the Lawrence Journal-World launched a live view of the local and state citizens fulfilling their democratic roles as citizens.
At 7pm CST we flipped the switch, waiting patiently while live data feeds poured in from Associated Press, Kansas Secretary of State and Douglas County.</p>

<h4>Wednesday, November 1, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>For the past few projects I&rsquo;ve thrown out all use of pixels and relied heavily on an em&rsquo;s and percentages for layout and font sizing. Why would someone take such drastic measures? Two simple reasons: usability and flexibility.
The current site, circa Fall 2006, uses this practice which makes the liquid layout possible with ease. A non-liquid example would be the Ellington site which uses a container set in EM&rsquo;s with all inner layers set to percentages.</p>

<h4>Tuesday, October 24, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>During my junior year of college I was required to enroll in a cinematography course as part of the Electronic Arts program. The first day of class we received a typical syllabus and course schedule. Then we immediately dove into a topic that I still remember to this day, Gestalt psychology.
In its basic form, Gestalt tries to explain how we perceive more than the collected sum. Musical tunes can be recognized in different keys or with added notes.</p>

<h4>Wednesday, October 4, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>You may have noticed a little downtime Sunday evening. I was able to get the code under version control which I highly recommend. It allows you to kick FTP to the curb and do everything with &ldquo;svn commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; commands.
The main reason for doing this was my extreme inability to remember which files I&rsquo;ve changed. Subversion takes the worry out of my day by committing the necessary files from my local machine to my repository.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>I was involved in a discussion recently about whether journalists should be allowed to comment on news stories. My employer, the Lawrence Journal-World, allows the public to comment on online stories. Quick note: while I may work for the newspaper my experience with journalism at the time of this post is very informal. I am a member of the public, which in my opinion makes this opinion just as valid as any.</p>

<p>I just bought a new nano and Nike+ kit but I didn&rsquo;t want the Nike shoes nor did I care for the recent &lsquo;velcro&rsquo; hack. Instead of looking like a huge geek with a transmitter in my laces (http://podophile.com/2006/07/14/shoe-hacker-nikeipod-sport-kit-shoe-mod/), I decided to surgically insert the transmitter into my shoe tongue.

<p>Last night I was doing a little house cleaning and drifted off to reminiscing mode. I didn&rsquo;t realize how many redesigns I&rsquo;ve gone through and the ones that never made the cut. In some cases I kinda wish they did. So as a follow up to Slightly neurotic on change I&rsquo;ll prove this neurosis with the following dusty relics from the past:

<h4>Monday, September 11, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>So back in the Fall of 2005 I launched my foray into the world of Rails like every other designer wannabe programmer. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I did it because everyone else was. Looking back I don&rsquo;t really know why, I just followed the &ldquo;if it feels good, do it&rdquo; principle.
Out of that decision grew a love/hate relationship. I&rsquo;m primarily a designer but I like sticking my hands in the programming cookie jar.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>So how easy is it to yank out all links in a post and display them as a list on their own? Well with a little Python love and some Django filters it&rsquo;s easy as microwave burritos. Before we get started you&rsquo;ll need a fresh copy of ElementTree and BeautifulSoup.
ElementTree (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm) and BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) together form a very handy toolbox for parsing structured data. ElementTree is used a lot for parsing XML and BeautifulSoup is tailored more towards parsing XHTML.</p>

<p>Context can be described as, &ldquo;the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed.&rdquo; Context plays an important role in communication and I&rsquo;d like start by providing better context to posts.

<p>In the 20&rsquo;s we fought prohibition, 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s it was segregation. Today we face a new battle called privacy. I bring this up because in todays Lawrence Journal-World Sarah Benson wrote an interesting article titled Facebook indiscretions plague users (http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/12/facebook_indiscretions_plague_users/).
In her article she gives two examples of the unintended consequences of social networking. The first outlines how an employer can peer into prospective employees social pasts using current employee accounts.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know why but deletion just bugs me. Maybe its my pack rat mentality but to delete is to lose. I write blog entries all the time that don&rsquo;t get published and sometimes I completely rewrite them losing past versions.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/rules-rule/>Rules Rule</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, April 17, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>As children we grew up hating curfew, as adolescence we rebelled against the drinking age, and as adults we shake our fists at stop lights and speed limits. What we don&rsquo;t realize is rules set us free.
I came across this simple notion in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&rsquo;s book Flow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/). By having laws and rules we free ourselves from contemplating things that have already been determined. This provides a framework for thought which is valuable when applied to design.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2006/my-easter/>My Easter</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, April 16, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Woke up around 11:30 after a long night of coding (http://www.rubyonrails.com). Had a turkey sandwich and some pretzels while watching some television (http://www.historychannel.com). Packed up some essentials: laptop (http://www.apple.com/powerbook/), couple (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/) books (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024114/), and headphones (http://www.stanc.net/eggo/). Drove to the cafe (http://www.broadwaycafeandroastery.com) that breaks for no resurrection. Had a soy latte while improving some Rails code and listening to some music (http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=2960659&amp;amp;s=143441). Then I came home, worked out, read (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007655/), and listened to some piano.</p>

<h4>Thursday, April 6, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Just got back from a session with Jason Collett (http://www.arts-crafts.ca/jasoncollett/) from Broken Social Scene (http://www.arts-crafts.ca/bss/). I highly recommend checking this man out. Has sort of a modern day Bob Dylan appeal with fresh percussion. Their newest album, Idols of Exile, offers quaint morsels of Canadian goodness. If you&rsquo;re in need of something fresh and lighthearted, look no further. I only wish Mrs. Feist could have made an appearance.</p>

<h4>Tuesday, March 14, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I already miss waking up in the morning and planning my day at the Hide Out over a cup of joe. I miss that walk from 7th and Congress to the convention center seeing fellow lanyards. More importantly I miss seeing those who contribute so much to the beautiful corners of our web.
There were some great panel lineups and as much as I love hearing about tech and code I felt like distancing myself from the technical aspects of our industry and focus on listening to what others had to say about the roles psychology and sociology play in what we do.</p>

<h4>Sunday, March 5, 2006</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>At what point does interactive design become temporal art over plastic art? This question seems to be rare yet extremely important in our decision making process. This (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060391685/) book prompted my pondering of this.
To clarify, temporal art includes poetry, writing, film and music. Plastic art takes the form of painting, drawing and sculpture. What sets the two apart is that fourth dimension, time. The success of temporal art is in its progressive events leading up to a fulfilling end, better known as climax.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes from the Godfather trillogy is when Michael Corleone wisly reminds Vinnie, &ldquo;never let anyone know what you are thinking.&rdquo;
The importance of this is astronomical in client meetings. Never bring new ideas to the table in a client meeting. Bring vetted ideas. Prepare yourself before the meeting. Have concept sessions with colleagues, visualize the ideas, make sure you have the resources and be sure the idea is possible.</p>

<p>Bored tonight so I thought I&rsquo;d impregnate some coders out there with some of my seed. My hopes are that this will cause you to give birth to better code. I am pro choice so if you choose to abort I understand whole heartedly. Before you do so please consider adoption, there are plenty of other good coders out there that may benefit.
Ok, enough metaphors. This is some actionscript I did over Christmas (download code (/code/flash_template.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>Thank God it&rsquo;s Friday. I&rsquo;m planning another one of my &ldquo;introvert retreats.&rdquo; About two weeks ago at 5 o&rsquo;clock CST I turned off all forms of communication. The following day I drove to Lawrence, Kansas sans laptop. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like anything too special but the resulting clarity and relaxation was well worth it.
This weekend I&rsquo;ll be cutting it a little short so I can be somewhat social Saturday night. The trip to Lawrence is a go and I&rsquo;ll be invading an undisclosed dark coffee house chugging away on my laptop.</p>

<div class=summary>
<p>I work with a small team of designers inside a very large ad agency. Like most ad agencies they focus primarily on print and broadcast. Having a small web division can sometimes cause confusion between the different mediums.
I never really realized how different web was from print and broadcast until my time at an agency. So I&rsquo;ve compiled a quick list of a few items that I think set web apart.</p>

<p>When the name Playground Blues was chosen I was a junior in college. It didn&rsquo;t carry much meaning other than playgrounds seemed like whimsical places where imagination wondered. I feel I&rsquo;ve grown out of the name.
Playground Blues has meant a lot to me. It&rsquo;s enjoyed roughly five official redesigns, god knows how many unofficial. It&rsquo;s been featured on many sites including The Daily Report (http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot) by Jeffrey Zeldman, Moluv (http://www.</p>

<p>The new and improved webcam is BACK! It now allows you to post messages. When you do it attaches the current image and keeps a running archive of past webcam moments. It&rsquo;s quite possible this is a first in web history. Could I be so lucky?
For those of you who were wondering&mldr; Evocam is being used to FTP images every 30 seconds. Some handy flash work is being used to serve the newest image to my people.</p>
