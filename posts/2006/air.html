# On Air


The new and improved [webcam](http://www.playgroundblues.com/webcam) is BACK! It now allows you to post messages. When you do it attaches the current image and keeps a running archive of past webcam moments. It's quite possible this is a first in web history.  Could I be so lucky?

For those of you who were wondering... [Evocam](http://www.evological.com/evocam.html) is being used to FTP images every 30 seconds. Some handy flash work is being used to serve the newest image to my people. [Rails](http://www.playgroundblues.com) is being used to take comments and associate the current photo with the comment. Enough nerd speak, check it out, leave a comment.
