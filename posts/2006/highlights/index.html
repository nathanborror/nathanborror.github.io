<p>I&rsquo;m notorious for highlighting. At home, I&rsquo;m surrounded by a rapidly growing
library. Some books have been read cover to cover, some cover to creamy center,
and some randomly picked through. But, I can confidently guarantee, each has
felt the screeching of my fat yellow Avery HI-LITER.</p>
<p>Why? Maybe it&rsquo;s an incessant urge to mark my territory or a worry that I&rsquo;ll
forget a phrase that made my grey matter jiggle. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure but when I
revisit books and read this highlighted material memories flood my mind. The
hard part is remembering what I&rsquo;ve highlighted and trying to make relations
between highlights.</p>
<p>To aid in this I&rsquo;ve put together a little application called Highlights
(<a href=http://highlights.youknowwhereyouare.com/)>http://highlights.youknowwhereyouare.com/)</a>. It&rsquo;s very basic and allows me to
keep a journal of all my readings and thoughts. This also serves as my book list
for those of you asking me what I&rsquo;ve been reading lately. Feel free to peruse
(<a href=http://highlights.youknowwhereyouare.com/)>http://highlights.youknowwhereyouare.com/)</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking about adding some
folksonomies (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy</a>) to allow for better
relationships to form between entires. Seaching will be available soon. Any
suggestions are welcome with open arms.</p>
<p>Update: I&rsquo;ll be porting Highlights to Django very soon and adding some fun new
features. If you have any suggestions feel free to comment.</p>
