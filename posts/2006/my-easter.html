# My Easter

Woke up around 11:30 after a long night of [coding](http://www.rubyonrails.com). Had a turkey sandwich and some pretzels while watching some [television](http://www.historychannel.com). Packed up some essentials: [laptop](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/), [couple](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/) [books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024114/), and [headphones](http://www.stanc.net/eggo/). Drove to the [cafe](http://www.broadwaycafeandroastery.com) that breaks for no resurrection. Had a soy latte while improving some Rails code and listening to some [music](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=2960659&amp;s=143441). Then I came home, worked out, [read](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007655/), and listened to some piano. Now I'm just finishing up rearranging my loft. Happy Easter everyone!
