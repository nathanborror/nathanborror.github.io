are pouring (<a href="http://www.mcelhearn.com/article.php?story=20060808113448585">http://www.mcelhearn.com/article.php?story=20060808113448585</a>) in
regarding this years WWDC keynote. Each critiquing the slightest moves Steve
Jobs made or didn&rsquo;t make. This <em>shared</em> keynote in particular has raised the
question, &ldquo;is Jobs preparing for departure?&rdquo; Just the notion spreads fear
amongst even the most liberal mac fanatics.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about the importance of hiring the right people. Wikipedia
defines company (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company</a>) as a &ldquo;legal entity formed
which has a separate legal identity from its members.&rdquo; This definition is
bullshit. It&rsquo;s the reason why most companies are selfless and full of boring
individuals with zero curiosity or ownership. If companies want to captivate our
minds they have to do it through soul. Catchy logos and tag lines are important
but if the people of a company lack class or style, the products will too.</p>
<p>When I know whose behind a great product, I appreciate it so much more. This can
also carry many dangers as I&rsquo;m sure we all know. In particular, retirement or
&ldquo;natures change agent.&rdquo;</p>
