<p>As children we grew up hating curfew, as adolescence we rebelled against the
drinking age, and as adults we shake our fists at stop lights and speed limits.
What we don&rsquo;t realize is rules set us free.</p>
<p>I came across this simple notion in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&rsquo;s book Flow
(<a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/)>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/)</a>. By having laws and rules we free
ourselves from contemplating things that have already been determined. This
provides a framework for thought which is valuable when applied to design.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how hard it is to be original? Thinking up a completely
new idea from scratch is extremely daunting. So don&rsquo;t. Stop trying to reinvent
the wheel and start improving it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to embrace the basic
properties and laws of something with the determination of making it better.
This at least gets you in gear and you&rsquo;ll be surprised what original ideas will
sprout up once the wheels are moving. It&rsquo;s better to be producing than
deadlocked on what to produce.</p>
