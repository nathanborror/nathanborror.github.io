<p>When the name Playground Blues was chosen I was a junior in college. It didn&rsquo;t
carry much meaning other than playgrounds seemed like whimsical places where
imagination wondered. I feel I&rsquo;ve grown out of the name.</p>
<p>Playground Blues has meant a lot to me. It&rsquo;s enjoyed roughly five official
redesigns, god knows how many unofficial. It&rsquo;s been featured on many sites
including The Daily Report (<a href=http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot>http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0504e.shtml#reboot</a>) by
Jeffrey Zeldman, Moluv (<a href="http://www.moluv.com/fsa.asp?startingPoint=197)">http://www.moluv.com/fsa.asp?startingPoint=197)</a>, CSS
Vault (<a href=http://cssvault.com/redesigned/playground_blues.php)>http://cssvault.com/redesigned/playground_blues.php)</a>, Stylegala
(<a href=http://www.stylegala.com/archive/playground_blues.htm)>http://www.stylegala.com/archive/playground_blues.htm)</a>, and was honorably
mentioned at the 2004 May 1st Reboot (<a href=http://www.may1reboot.com/2004)>http://www.may1reboot.com/2004)</a>.</p>
<p>I bid Playground Blues farewell as I introduce to you You Know Where You Are.
YKWYA represents me, now. The idea is simple, <strong>Real Content</strong>, which means
fresh links, <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/>photos</a>, audio, camera
feeds (/webcam) and experiments. My first experiment can literally be seen in
the upper right corner of the home page. I hope you enjoy this new direction as
it evolves. Always more to come!</p>
