<p>You may have noticed a little downtime Sunday evening. I was able to get the
Domaki code under version control (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control</a>)
which I highly recommend. It allows you to kick FTP to the curb and do
everything with &ldquo;svn commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; commands.</p>
<p>The main reason for doing this was my extreme inability to remember which files
I&rsquo;ve changed. Subversion (<a href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>) takes the worry out of
my day by committing the necessary files from my local machine to my repository.
I can then update my live site copy with a simple update command. My setup is
pretty simple. My repository is on Dreamhost. I have have a local copy checked
out on my laptop where I make my changes. I have another copy checked out on
Dreamhost thats served up fresh to you. I commit changes via my local terminal
and ssh to my live directory on Dreamhost to update the code to the latest
version. Pretty simple!</p>
<p>Trac (<a href=http://trac.edgewall.org/>http://trac.edgewall.org/</a>) is also handy for navigating the repository
online but acts more as a project management tool. Anytime I come across a bug
or a UI enhancement I can open a ticket to Trac which can be closed upon
completion. It can also review and compare changes of any file if you ever have
to roll a file back to an older version.</p>
<p>Textmate (<a href=http://macromates.com/>http://macromates.com/</a>) has some handy Subversion key commands but I
haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fully explore them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Django or Python make sure you edit your config file under your
hidden .subversion directory to exclude .pyc files. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be making a
ton of unnecessary file updates.</p>
