# Jason Collett

Just got back from a session with [Jason Collett](http://www.arts-crafts.ca/jasoncollett/) from [Broken Social Scene.](http://www.arts-crafts.ca/bss/) I highly recommend checking this man out. Has sort of a modern day Bob Dylan appeal with fresh percussion. Their newest album, Idols of Exile, offers quaint morsels of Canadian goodness. If you're in need of something fresh and lighthearted, look no further. I only wish Mrs. Feist could have made an appearance.
