<p>It&rsquo;s my prediction that over the next few years we&rsquo;re going to see a rise of
localized social networks/directories. Localized social networks can augment and
enhance real world local communities, if the recipe is just right. The first
ingredient is key for any up-and-comming project summoning user authentication.</p>
<p>The key to localized networks and other new applications that fill particular
niches is OpenID (<a href=http://openid.net/)>http://openid.net/)</a>. Consistency among user profiles is
non-existant. OpenID brings with it a pure, centralized repository for profile
management where you&rsquo;re empowered to adjust the strings of privacy based on
sites you&rsquo;ve opened the doors too. It looks like PIP by VeriSign (<a href=http://pip.verisignlabs.com/>http://pip.verisignlabs.com/</a>)
is already laying the ground work.</p>
<p>Not only does this create consistent profiles, it keeps track of what we belong
to without the hassle of remembering passwords and usernames. Imagine changing
your email address in a single location and having it propagate to every social
network, online application, bank account and various admin tools. Bliss, and
hopefully a reality.</p>
