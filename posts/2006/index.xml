        <p>Two thousand six was full of spontaneous moments with great friends and
coworkers. It also had some noteworthy, personal milestones that I thought I&rsquo;d
highlight before the clock strikes twelve.</p>
<p>January / February saw the launch of Authentic Films (<a href="http://www.authenticfilms.net">http://www.authenticfilms.net</a>).
It was my first official jump into the world of Actionscript and thanks to
Travis (<a href="http://www.podlob.com">http://www.podlob.com</a>) the water wasn&rsquo;t that cold.</p>
<p>March / April involved traveling to Austin, Texas where I attended my first SXSW
conference (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/tags/sxswi/)">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/tags/sxswi/)</a>. It was great to meet
more geeks like myself. I got my ears blown out by Alkaline Trio
(<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/136194688/in/dateposted/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/136194688/in/dateposted/</a>) for the second time
and got a lot of use out of the Jazz bar below my loft.</p>
<p>May / June was spent reading (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032564/in/dateposted/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032564/in/dateposted/</a>)
a lot (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032185/in/dateposted/)">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032185/in/dateposted/)</a>.</p>
<p>July / August got me thinking which lead to my decision to leave advertising and
enter the world of journalism. I saw some fireworks (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/182667304/in/dateposted/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/182667304/in/dateposted/</a>)
and became very close with a great coffee house (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/201018003/in/dateposted/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/201018003/in/dateposted/</a>)
in my new neighborhood. I also launched a new site for Take Two (<a href="http://www.t2.tv">http://www.t2.tv</a>)
and Firehouse (<a href="http://www.fhdallas.com">http://www.fhdallas.com</a>).</p>
<p>September / October showed me how hard it is to be a teacher. For the first time
I taught a course in web design at the Kansas City Art Institute. At the same
time I enrolled in a letterpress class (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/archives/date-posted/2006/09/12/">http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/archives/date-posted/2006/09/12/</a>)
at the arts center in my neighborhood where I did a lino carving (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jcroft/272761102/">http://flickr.com/photos/jcroft/272761102/</a>)
for the first time since high school.</p>
<p>November / December allowed me to flex some info design muscle for the election
coverage. Matt (<a href="http://postneo.com/">http://postneo.com/</a>) pulled off some amazing information
gathering to make my silly (<a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/secretary_state/">http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/secretary_state/</a>)
little graphics bloom.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in store for 2007? Well, a lot. I can&rsquo;t wait to share some of the things
I&rsquo;ve been working on. There is a redesign (<a href="http://www.ljworld.com">http://www.ljworld.com</a>) in the works
and a lot of loose (<a href="http://www.podjogger.com">http://www.podjogger.com</a>) ends (<a href="http://jupiter.playgroundblues.com">http://jupiter.playgroundblues.com</a>)
that I&rsquo;m determined to wrap up. I hope everyone who reads this blog is enjoying
life as much as I am. Happy New Year!</p>

        <p>Print is about to die and we better prepare ourselves. I was doing some
christmas shopping last week and stumbled into a Sony Style story. I&rsquo;m not a fan
of the Sony brand but they do seem to come out with some daring devices. The
first thing that struck me was the Sony Reader (<a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/)">http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/)</a>.</p>
<p>The Sony Reader is basically a very thin screen that uses E-Ink technology
(<a href="http://eink.com/">http://eink.com/</a>) to display text and basic graphics. The resolution is
shocking, it&rsquo;s like staring at a piece of paper. The device has a lot of
problems and the operating system is pretty clunky and locked down but you can
tell this is the beginning of something.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, this dawn of reader devices will kill print. They will
get vibrant colors, more responsive interfaces, and durability. You can bet other
companies are developing their own devices and this is the end of the road for
print and it&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>

        <p>For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve consistently heard various permutations of
two phrases, &ldquo;I like&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Throw away, easy phrases. I&rsquo;ve never
valued the first and I&rsquo;ve had nothing but contempt for the second.</p>
<p>My professor in college would dock our grades when someone uttered one of these
phrases. He believed they were lame and comfortable. If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to
say, you didn&rsquo;t really have anything to say.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m still very young but these phrases seem to get older and older
each time I hear them. Design is agonizing. It&rsquo;s a complex battle of process
that consists of manipulation and experimentation, success and failure. These
phrases equate to flipping a coin with little value and do nothing but distract
by casting a false sense of success or failure.</p>
<p>If all you have is &ldquo;I like&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; then you haven&rsquo;t looked hard
enough. You haven&rsquo;t taken the time to objectively understand what you&rsquo;re seeing
or experiencing. Then, and only then, will you be able to articulate what you
are feeling or what you are not feeling.</p>

        <p>If Libraries want to stay relevant they have to redefine their role in
communities. The common perception is they have books, lots of books. This is
obvious. Over the last decade the perception has grown to include internet
access. However, this isn&rsquo;t enough to survive. If you live in a progressive town
like myself, WiFi is ubiquitous. When the Library is competing with Henry&rsquo;s
Coffeehouse, well, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you who wins.</p>
<p>In the next half decade we&rsquo;ll most likely have access to any book imaginable
through the use of a single device. Whether we like this idea or not it will at
some point replace the role of the book. Books have lived a long life when
compared to the Music medium. Music has been on a steady pace of evolution from
vinyl to eight track to cassette to CD and now digital. Digital seems to be the
evolutionary end because it&rsquo;s intangible. Google is hard at work scanning the
Worlds books which are longing for a digital resting place.</p>
<p>Do Libraries become insignificant when digital books reach a tipping point? Not
unless they transform their role as repositories of knowledge to places of
gathering. Nothing can replace face to face interactions. When we gain knowledge
we ultimately seek understanding.</p>
<p>When Open Source infected the programming world it became one of the most
significant movements in history. The speed with which we&rsquo;ve created the
Information Age would not have been possible without this movement. If Libraries
applied the Open Source philosophy to Education they could usher in the dawn of
a new age, The Age of Education. This could rival some of the best Universities.
This wouldn&rsquo;t be a normal teacher/class education. The books would be our
teachers. People would roam the halls seeking other people. Understanding would
be gained through discussion and debate. Some of us would travel long distances
to Libraries famous for their people and discussions.</p>
<p>For centuries Libraries have been entrusted with housing knowledge. That trust
is quickly being handed over to the Internet. Libraries now have the opportunity
to be handed the trust of understanding.</p>
<p>The preceding was sparked by some plans I saw for a new Library to be built in
my town of Lawrence, Kansas. The design feels so open and welcoming with its
huge windows and roof top gardens. It has a sense of curiosity with it&rsquo;s
inconsistent fourth floor appearing to look in a different direction than the
other floors. It feels like a place I would go to have conversations and seek
understanding.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve launched a lot of web projects in my career, but none of them have come
close to the excitement of this evenings whirlwind. For the 2006 elections our
little group called World Online at the Lawrence Journal-World launched a live
view of the local and state citizens fulfilling their democratic roles as citizens.</p>
<p>At 7pm CST we flipped the switch, waiting patiently while live data feeds poured
in from Associated Press, Kansas Secretary of State and Douglas County. I&rsquo;ve done
Flash projects before and normally you working with static of semi-dynamic data
but I&rsquo;ve never semi-blindly uploaded files that would soon be feed information
from places I&rsquo;d never seen before and viewed by literally thousands of people
instantaneously. As soon as data poured in changes had to be made, graphics
added, inconsistencies spotted. The rush was amazing.</p>
<p>!http://media.domaki.com/www/election_map.jpg</p>
<p>This map (<a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/state_treasurer/">http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/state_treasurer/</a>)
shows voter turn out and candidate totals across Douglas County in Kansas.
What&rsquo;s amazing is the story data can tell just by being represented in a simple
fashion using basic design principles.</p>
<p>Tonight was a thrill and it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if it wasn&rsquo;t for the
hard work and dedication that our team has towards delivering data to its
audience. I&rsquo;m already excited for 2008!</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s my prediction that over the next few years we&rsquo;re going to see a rise of
localized social networks/directories. Localized social networks can augment and
enhance real world local communities, if the recipe is just right. The first
ingredient is key for any up-and-comming project summoning user authentication.</p>
<p>The key to localized networks and other new applications that fill particular
niches is OpenID (<a href="http://openid.net/)">http://openid.net/)</a>. Consistency among user profiles is
non-existant. OpenID brings with it a pure, centralized repository for profile
management where you&rsquo;re empowered to adjust the strings of privacy based on
sites you&rsquo;ve opened the doors too. It looks like PIP by VeriSign (<a href="http://pip.verisignlabs.com/">http://pip.verisignlabs.com/</a>)
is already laying the ground work.</p>
<p>Not only does this create consistent profiles, it keeps track of what we belong
to without the hassle of remembering passwords and usernames. Imagine changing
your email address in a single location and having it propagate to every social
network, online application, bank account and various admin tools. Bliss, and
hopefully a reality.</p>

        <p>For the past few projects I&rsquo;ve thrown out all use of pixels and relied heavily on an em&rsquo;s and percentages for layout and font sizing. Why would someone take such drastic measures? Two simple reasons: usability and flexibility.</p>
<p>The current site, circa Fall 2006, uses this practice which makes the liquid layout possible with ease. A non-liquid example would be the <a href="http://www.ellingtoncms.com">Ellington</a> site which uses a container set in EM&rsquo;s with all
inner layers set to percentages. When you increase the font size the layout scales appropriately, thus demonstrating good usability (or accessibility &ndash; I think they are one in the same).</p>
<p>Have you ever stood back and wondered, &ldquo;should this site be wider?&rdquo; Well with one miniscule change it can. Simply alter the container layer and everything follows suite as long as your inner layers have all been assigned percentages. The biggest caveat to this is dealing with IE not behaving well with 100% in certain situations. I&rsquo;ve gotten around this by trying not to be so pixel perfect and looking at things more loosely. Upon doing more and more complex column layouts I&rsquo;ve come to love this method of styling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to see more liquid layouts or at least taking into consideration that the canvas we have is not fixed. Most of the software applications on our computer are liquid why not web sites?</p>
<p>Tip: Set the font-style property of the body tag to 62.5%. This makes 1em look like 10px, and so on.</p>

        <p>During my junior year of college I was required to enroll in a cinematography
course as part of the Electronic Arts program. The first day of class we
received a typical syllabus and course schedule. Then we immediately dove into a
topic that I still remember to this day, Gestalt psychology.</p>
<p>In its basic form, Gestalt tries to explain how we perceive more than the
collected sum. Musical tunes can be recognized in different keys or with added
notes. Instead of seeing individual leafs on a tree we see branches, birds, sky,
and grass. Foreground and background blend together to create a complete picture.
&ldquo;&hellip; although a wheel is made of 30 spokes, it is the space between the spokes
that determines the overall form.&rdquo; &ndash; Tao Te Ching</p>
<p>Designers juggle their time between foreground and background elements with the
hopes of ensuring a harmony between the two. If one is neglected the design can
easily fail; becoming more aware of this can help produce a more desirable
composition.</p>
<p>One of the last remaining original Gestalt psychologists, Rudolf Arnheim,
recently referred to the decline of modern design as, &ldquo;unbrilled extravagance, a
vulgarity of taste, and triviality of thought.&rdquo; I see a lot of evidence
supporting this statement on a daily basis. My conscious tells me design should
be timeless. Instead of spending hours trying to determine the new fad we should
be researching the psychological effects of design and closely study the masters.
This is the path I&rsquo;ve decided to try for now.</p>

        <p>You may have noticed a little downtime Sunday evening. I was able to get the code under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control</a> which I highly recommend. It allows you to kick FTP to the curb and do everything with &ldquo;svn commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; commands.</p>
<p>The main reason for doing this was my extreme inability to remember which files I&rsquo;ve changed. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> takes the worry out of my day by committing the necessary files from my local machine to my repository. I can then update my live site copy with a simple update command. My setup is pretty simple. My repository is on Dreamhost. I have have a local copy checked out on my laptop where I make my changes. I have another copy checked out on Dreamhost thats served up fresh to you. I commit changes via my local terminal and ssh to my live directory on Dreamhost to update the code to the latest version. Pretty simple!</p>
<p><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> is also handy for navigating the repository online but acts more as a project management tool. Anytime I come across a bug or a UI enhancement I can open a ticket to Trac which can be closed upon
completion. It can also review and compare changes of any file if you ever have to roll a file back to an older version.</p>
<p><a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> has some handy Subversion key commands but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fully explore them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Django or Python make sure you edit your config file under your hidden .subversion directory to exclude .pyc files. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be making a ton of unnecessary file updates.</p>

        <p>I was involved in a discussion recently about whether journalists should be
allowed to comment on news stories. My employer, the Lawrence Journal-World,
allows the public to comment on online stories. Quick note: while I may work for
the newspaper my experience with journalism at the time of this post is very
informal. I am a member of the public, which in my opinion makes this opinion
just as valid as any.</p>
<p>Journalists have an obligation to participate in the public discourse so long as
they adhere to the principles of journalistic (<a href="http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles">http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles</a>)
integrity. The delivery of news over an interactive medium allows for a closer
relationship between a journalist and their audience. Why should a journalist
end a story at the last sentence? Journalists sort through a variety of data to
form their story which makes their participation essential in discussing or
correcting the presented, edited data.</p>
<p>Journalism&rsquo;s purpose is to strengthen communities. Journalist forum
participation not only enhances a story, it bridges the perceived gap between
journalist and reader. I would even bet that over time it would increase
participation and readership.</p>
