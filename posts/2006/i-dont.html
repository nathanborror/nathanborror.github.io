# I don't like

For as long as I can remember I've consistently heard various permutations of two phrases, "I like" and "I don't like." Throw away, easy phrases. I've never valued the first and I've had nothing but contempt for the second.

My professor in college would dock our grades when someone uttered one of these phrases. He believed they were lame and comfortable. If that's all you've got to say, you didn't really have anything to say.

I realize I'm still very young but these phrases seem to get older and older each time I hear them. Design is agonizing. It's a complex battle of process that consists of manipulation and experimentation, success and failure. These phrases equate to flipping a coin with little value and do nothing but distract by casting a false sense of success or failure.

If all you have is "I like" or "I don't like," then you haven't looked hard enough. You haven't taken the time to objectively understand what you're seeing or experiencing. Then, and only then, will you be able to articulate what you are feeling or what you are not feeling.
