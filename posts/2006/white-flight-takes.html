# White Flight takes off.

Holly fucking shit you have to listen to [White Flight](http://rangeliferecords.com/listen/listen_WF_02.html) right now! Yesterday I stepped into my boss's very slick auto to pick up some pies for a late night work dinner and I expect some NPR, instead I get a feeling I got the first time I heard Postal Service.

Not since my Postal Service experience have I heard music of this caliber. [Justin Roelofs](http://www.lawrence.com/blogs/street_level/2005/dec/09/hownow/), from The Anniversary, has managed to enter a realm that has no explanation. It's actually original which is rare in a saturated world of _alternative_ music. I'm confident this will infect you well into the Fall.
