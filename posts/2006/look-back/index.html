<p>Two thousand six was full of spontaneous moments with great friends and
coworkers. It also had some noteworthy, personal milestones that I thought I&rsquo;d
highlight before the clock strikes twelve.</p>
<p>January / February saw the launch of Authentic Films (<a href=http://www.authenticfilms.net>http://www.authenticfilms.net</a>).
It was my first official jump into the world of Actionscript and thanks to
Travis (<a href=http://www.podlob.com>http://www.podlob.com</a>) the water wasn&rsquo;t that cold.</p>
<p>March / April involved traveling to Austin, Texas where I attended my first SXSW
conference (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/tags/sxswi/)>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/tags/sxswi/)</a>. It was great to meet
more geeks like myself. I got my ears blown out by Alkaline Trio
(<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/136194688/in/dateposted/>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/136194688/in/dateposted/</a>) for the second time
and got a lot of use out of the Jazz bar below my loft.</p>
<p>May / June was spent reading (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032564/in/dateposted/>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032564/in/dateposted/</a>)
a lot (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032185/in/dateposted/)>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/164032185/in/dateposted/)</a>.</p>
<p>July / August got me thinking which lead to my decision to leave advertising and
enter the world of journalism. I saw some fireworks (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/182667304/in/dateposted/>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/182667304/in/dateposted/</a>)
and became very close with a great coffee house (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/201018003/in/dateposted/>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/201018003/in/dateposted/</a>)
in my new neighborhood. I also launched a new site for Take Two (<a href=http://www.t2.tv>http://www.t2.tv</a>)
and Firehouse (<a href=http://www.fhdallas.com>http://www.fhdallas.com</a>).</p>
<p>September / October showed me how hard it is to be a teacher. For the first time
I taught a course in web design at the Kansas City Art Institute. At the same
time I enrolled in a letterpress class (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/archives/date-posted/2006/09/12/>http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/archives/date-posted/2006/09/12/</a>)
at the arts center in my neighborhood where I did a lino carving (<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/jcroft/272761102/>http://flickr.com/photos/jcroft/272761102/</a>)
for the first time since high school.</p>
<p>November / December allowed me to flex some info design muscle for the election
coverage. Matt (<a href=http://postneo.com/>http://postneo.com/</a>) pulled off some amazing information
gathering to make my silly (<a href=http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/secretary_state/>http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2006/nov/07/races/secretary_state/</a>)
little graphics bloom.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in store for 2007? Well, a lot. I can&rsquo;t wait to share some of the things
I&rsquo;ve been working on. There is a redesign (<a href=http://www.ljworld.com>http://www.ljworld.com</a>) in the works
and a lot of loose (<a href=http://www.podjogger.com>http://www.podjogger.com</a>) ends (<a href=http://jupiter.playgroundblues.com>http://jupiter.playgroundblues.com</a>)
that I&rsquo;m determined to wrap up. I hope everyone who reads this blog is enjoying
life as much as I am. Happy New Year!</p>
