<p>What better way to celebrate our independence than roaring into space in one of
the most complex machines ever built! You can watch this miraculous display of
human engineering at NASA.gov (<a href=http://www.nasa.gov/)>http://www.nasa.gov/)</a>.</p>
<p>Space exploration gives me goose bumps. My heart skips a beat when, just for one
second, I try to comprehend its limitless nature. To think we&rsquo;re able to
catapult seven of our greatest minds into this vacuum of questions and answers
makes me pause and wonder what we&rsquo;ll choose to achieve next. World peace,
hydrogen power, healthcare for everyone, or the tallest of dreams are so
attainable when we place them next to our accomplishments.</p>
<p>What I saw today was remarkable, there was no red or blue, no debate, just a
group of dedicated patriots. Our achievements should show us nothing less than
anything is possible if we clear our hearts, our minds and choose to step
forward. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, is all it takes.</p>
