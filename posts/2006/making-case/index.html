<p>Why is it that certain days I opt for the Man&rsquo;s coffee and other days I champion
the locals? I thought it had something to do with consistency but that&rsquo;s
bullshit. While the Man&rsquo;s store is well designed and has a familiar atmosphere
it reeks of fake smiles, stale business folk, and overly perfect pastries.
Admittedly those dainty pastries are quite wonderful, but thats besides the
point.</p>
<p>The locals aren&rsquo;t afraid to show attitude, they&rsquo;re real, they proudly bear the
title, Barista. The customers are genuine, eclectic and unpredictable. Plus you
feel honored to support local uniqueness and individuality.</p>
<p>So why do I still drink from the Man&rsquo;s hand? I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe it&rsquo;s because
they have better parking.</p>
