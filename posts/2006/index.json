The common perception is they have books, lots of books. This is\nobvious. Over the last decade the perception has grown to include internet\naccess. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to survive. If you live in a progressive town\nlike myself, WiFi is ubiquitous.

The speed with which we\u0026rsquo;ve created the\nInformation Age would not have been possible without this movement. If Libraries\napplied the Open Source philosophy to Education they could usher in the dawn of\na new age, The Age of Education. This could rival some of the best Universities.\nThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a normal teacher/class education. The books would be our\nteachers. People would roam the halls seeking other people.

Quick note: while I may work for\nthe newspaper my experience with journalism at the time of this post is very\ninformal. I am a member of the public, which in my opinion makes this opinion\njust as valid as any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJournalists have an obligation to participate in the public discourse so long as\nthey adhere to the principles of journalistic (\u003ca href=\"http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles\"\u003ehttp://www.journalism.org/resources/principles\u003c/a\u003e)\nintegrity. The delivery of news over an interactive medium allows for a closer\nrelationship between a journalist and their audience. Why should a journalist\nend a story at the last sentence? Journalists sort through a variety of data to\nform their story which makes their participation essential in discussing or\ncorrecting the presented, edited data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJournalism\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to strengthen communities. Journalist forum\nparticipation not only enhances a story, it bridges the perceived gap between\njournalist and reader. I would even bet that over time it would increase\nparticipation and readership.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]}
