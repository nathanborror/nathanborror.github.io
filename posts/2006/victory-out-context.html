# Victory Out of Context

>[President Bush](http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-05-27-voa17.cfm) says, just as the United States persevered and ultimately won the Cold War against communism, America will emerge victorious in the war on terror.

It's misleading and irresponsible to imply the possibility of victory over terror. It is idealistically impossible to abolish a feeling. People will always fear and at times that fear will escalate to terror. From the time we are born we learn fear, it aids in our survival until the day we die. Our responsibility is to not let fear overshadow happiness. If we choose to be free we must accept the accompanying dangers.
