# Collective Soul

The [reviews](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/cultofmac/0,71557-0.html?tw=wn_technology_4) are [pouring](http://www.mcelhearn.com/article.php?story=20060808113448585) in regarding this years WWDC keynote. Each critiquing the slightest moves Steve Jobs made or didn't make. This _shared_ keynote in particular has raised the question, "is Jobs preparing for departure?" Just the notion spreads fear amongst even the most liberal mac fanatics.

This got me thinking about the importance of hiring the right people. Wikipedia defines [company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company) as a "legal entity formed which has a separate legal identity from its members." This definition is bullshit. It's the reason why most companies are selfless and full of boring individuals with zero curiosity or ownership. If companies want to captivate our minds they have to do it through soul. Catchy logos and tag lines are important but if the people of a company lack class or style, the products will too.

When I know whose behind a great product, I appreciate it so much more. This can also carry many dangers as I'm sure we all know. In particular, retirement or "natures change agent."
