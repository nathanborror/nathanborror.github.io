<p>Context can be described as, &ldquo;the circumstances that form the setting for an
event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and
assessed.&rdquo; Context plays an important role in communication and I&rsquo;d like start
by providing better context to posts.</p>
<p>You may have noticed a left column on my blog post pages. It now contains geo
location information regarding where the post was written, categories it belongs
to, links that exist within the post and photos that were taken on the day the
it was published.</p>
<h1 id=what-does-all-this-mean>What does all this mean?</h1>
<p>The goal is to give posts an added level of meaning. In some instances I&rsquo;ve
noticed a correlation between photos
(<a href=http://www.domaki.com/posts/2006/jul/10/its-time-behave/>http://www.domaki.com/posts/2006/jul/10/its-time-behave/</a>) and what I decided to
write or maybe a location (<a href=http://www.domaki.com/posts/2005/sep/24/innocent-bystander/>http://www.domaki.com/posts/2005/sep/24/innocent-bystander/</a>)
inspired a post. Sometimes it may not be as apparent but, if anything, it brings
a little more life to information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on adding photos that correlate to the location pages once I have
time to play with the new geo data (<a href=http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/geotagging_one_.html>http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/geotagging_one_.html</a>)
in Flickr. I&rsquo;d love to see other examples of this practice. Suggestions are
always welcome.</p>
