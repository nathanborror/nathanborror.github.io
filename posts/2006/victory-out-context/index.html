<p>President Bush says, just as the United States persevered and ultimately won
the Cold War against communism, America will emerge victorious in the war on
terror. &ndash; <a href=http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-05-27-voa17.cfm>http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-05-27-voa17.cfm</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s misleading and irresponsible to imply the possibility of victory over
terror. It is idealistically impossible to abolish a feeling. People will always
fear and at times that fear will escalate to terror. From the time we are born
we learn fear, it aids in our survival until the day we die. Our responsibility
is to not let fear overshadow happiness. If we choose to be free we must accept
the accompanying dangers.</p>
