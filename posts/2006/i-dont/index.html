<p>For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve consistently heard various permutations of
two phrases, &ldquo;I like&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Throw away, easy phrases. I&rsquo;ve never
valued the first and I&rsquo;ve had nothing but contempt for the second.</p>
<p>My professor in college would dock our grades when someone uttered one of these
phrases. He believed they were lame and comfortable. If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to
say, you didn&rsquo;t really have anything to say.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m still very young but these phrases seem to get older and older
each time I hear them. Design is agonizing. It&rsquo;s a complex battle of process
that consists of manipulation and experimentation, success and failure. These
phrases equate to flipping a coin with little value and do nothing but distract
by casting a false sense of success or failure.</p>
<p>If all you have is &ldquo;I like&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; then you haven&rsquo;t looked hard
enough. You haven&rsquo;t taken the time to objectively understand what you&rsquo;re seeing
or experiencing. Then, and only then, will you be able to articulate what you
are feeling or what you are not feeling.</p>
