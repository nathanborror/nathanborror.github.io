# Making The Case

Why is it that certain days I opt for the Man's coffee and other days I champion the locals? I thought it had something to do with consistency but that's bullshit. While the Man's store is well designed and has a familiar atmosphere it reeks of fake smiles, stale business folk, and overly perfect pastries. Admittedly those dainty pastries are quite wonderful, but thats besides the point.

The locals aren't afraid to show attitude, they're real, they proudly bear the title, Barista. The customers are genuine, eclectic and unpredictable. Plus you feel honored to support local uniqueness and individuality.

So why do I still drink from the Man's hand? I don't know. Maybe it's because they have better parking.
