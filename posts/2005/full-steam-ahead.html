# Full Steam Ahead


Playground Blues is officially on [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com). Approximately [two weeks](http://playgroundblues.com/archive/bejeweled) ago I started chugging along and with this new language. Surprisingly it's been quite welcoming and easy to learn. I only wish it were just as easy to ween clients over to this oasis.

Along with the change of language came some other needed changes. One of them being my move from Textile to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) otherwise known as [BlueCloth](http://www.deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth) in Rails. Markdown just seemed more natural to the way I type. Another change included a new Flash Photoblog that is built using an [asynchronous event model](http://www.actionscript.org/tutorials/intermediate/Flash_Broadcasters_and_Listeners/index.shtml) philosophy. I've been trying to wrap my mind around this more and I think I'm beginning to understand its major benefits.

Stay tuned. This is an exciting endeavor and I've got a lot more tricks up my sleeve.
