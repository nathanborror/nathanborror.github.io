# Farewell and Hello

This is my last week at my current employer, [Look and Feel](http://www.lookandfeel.com) which would explain my lack of good posts. I can't express how fortunate I am to have spent time with the fine lads of LaF. I will miss them dearly, although, I'll still be living in the neighborhood so I'm sure our paths will cross.

My near future rests at a place called [Method](http://www.brmethod.com) within [Bernstein-Rein.](http://www.bernstein-rein.com) A fortune teller has forcasted very long hours but many laughs and Belgium beer flowing from the hill tops. Ok, maybe not the last one so much. I'll be #7 of an extremely talented group scrambling to keep up.
