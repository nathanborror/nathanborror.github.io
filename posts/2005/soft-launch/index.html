<p>This launch is softer than a baby&rsquo;s bum. Please excuse the possible broken
links, sparse content, grayed out links, and unusually shaped big toe.</p>
<p>Things should be up to speed by the end of this week so keep checking back from
time to time. Also, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll throw you a me update:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done photo blogging. It was fun while it lasted but I&rsquo;m out of good photos
so back to writing. I&rsquo;ll continue keeping my <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/>Flicker account</a> stocked with shiny visuals. Still
wondering the streets of Kansas City. Currently working on some cool projects
that I can&rsquo;t wait to share <em>more on those later</em>. I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of
emails about Jupiter, my project management software. This has lead me to
believe that I should finish that damn thing, soon. All is well for the most
part.</p>
<p>The evolution of this site should be fun and interesting so stay tuned.</p>
