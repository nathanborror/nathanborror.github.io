# Art Mobs

I have a new PodCast to add to your library. It's by [Art Mobs](http://mod.blogs.com/) and its called [Art Mobs MoMA Guides](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=74263942). The descriptions is "A 'Commons' for audio guides to artworks at the [Museum of Modern Art](http://www.moma.org), NYC." Basically an entertaining discussion about modern art. I think this is by far the most creative use of PodCasting, no pun intended.
