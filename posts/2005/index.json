Warning: I cannot guarantee \nI\u0026rsquo;ve finished these books. I have a tendency, possibly fear, of finishing books. \nI literally get to the last chapter and it sits on my coffee table for weeks. \nSo far, these have been intriguing books to me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlink and The Tipping Point\u003c/strong\u003e by Malcom Gladwell. I group these two together \nbecause they go hand in hand. Blink is about snap judgement. It takes a very \nmicro approach on how we make decisions in the blink of an eye. Tipping Point \nslaps on a macro lens and dives into how we as a society come to fall in love \nwith products. Both are fascinating and suited well for anyone interested in the \nhuman psyche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Whole New Mind\u003c/strong\u003e by Daniel Pink. The Information Age is nearing it\u0026rsquo;s slow \ndeath and we\u0026rsquo;re beginning to witness the rise of the Conceptual Age. Think twice \nabout getting that MBA. With the outsourcing of \u0026ldquo;information jobs\u0026rdquo; to Asia you \nmay want to investigate the fruits of the MFA. This book is a portal to many \nresources and it\u0026rsquo;s been keeping me very busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVoices of a People\u0026rsquo;s History of the United States\u003c/strong\u003e by Howard Zinn. How did I \nend up believing Christopher Columbus was a \u0026ldquo;great man\u0026rdquo; and worthy of his own \nday. This was a man that \u0026ldquo;kidnapped, maimed and killed the indigenous people of \nHispanola in pursuit of gold.\u0026rdquo; This book sheds much needed light on those who in \nthe face of opposition and hardship spoke out. This undeniable view of history \nis shocking and raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraphic Designers Guide to Clients by Ellen Shapiro. I used to be very defensive \naround clients. Mainly because I lacked the ability to put myself in their \nshoes. Shapiro provides numerous real world examples of successful client \nrelationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStory, Substance, Structure, Style, and The Principles of Screenwriting by \nRobert McKee. Why should a web designer care about story? It happens to be the \nvehicle to our minds. A good story can elicit any number of emotions. Emotions \nare products of the right side of our brain which is the gateway to the left. \nIn advertising or design we must be in tune with this so our message effectively \ncaptivates its audience. McKee intricately dissects the building blocks of good \nstory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully this will wet your appetite. Any number of these will make you think \ndifferently after setting them down.
