# Worm Club: I

Friends and cohorts keep asking me me to recommend books so in an effort to slightly curb this I've manifested the list below. Warning: I cannot guarantee I've finished these books. I have a tendency, possibly fear, of finishing books. I literally get to the last chapter and it sits on my coffee table for weeks. So far, these have been intriguing books to me:

**Blink and The Tipping Point** by Malcom Gladwell. I group these two together because they go hand in hand. Blink is about snap judgement. It takes a very micro approach on how we make decisions in the blink of an eye. Tipping Point slaps on a macro lens and dives into how we as a society come to fall in love with products. Both are fascinating and suited well for anyone interested in the human psyche.

**A Whole New Mind** by Daniel Pink. The Information Age is nearing it's slow death and we're beginning to witness the rise of the Conceptual Age. Think twice about getting that MBA. With the outsourcing of "information jobs" to Asia you may want to investigate the fruits of the MFA. This book is a portal to many resources and it's been keeping me very busy.

**Voices of a People's History of the United States** by Howard Zinn. How did I end up believing Christopher Columbus was a "great man" and worthy of his own day. This was a man that "kidnapped, maimed and killed the indigenous people of Hispanola in pursuit of gold." This book sheds much needed light on those who in the face of opposition and hardship spoke out. This undeniable view of history is shocking and raw.

**Graphic Designers Guide to Clients** by Ellen Shapiro. I used to be very defensive around clients. Mainly because I lacked the ability to put myself in their shoes. Shapiro provides numerous real world examples of successful client relationships.

**Story, Substance, Structure, Style, and The Principles of Screenwriting** by Robert McKee. Why should a web designer care about story? It happens to be the vehicle to our minds. A good story can elicit any number of emotions. Emotions are products of the right side of our brain which is the gateway to the left. In advertising or design we must be in tune with this so our message effectively captivates its audience. McKee intricately dissects the building blocks of good story.
Hopefully this will wet your appetite. Any number of these will make you think differently after setting them down. I've been permanently altered by all of them.
