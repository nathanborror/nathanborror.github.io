# Soft Launch

This launch is softer than a baby's bum. Please excuse the possible broken links, sparse content, grayed out links, and unusually shaped big toe.
Things should be up to speed by the end of this week so keep checking back from time to time. Also, if you don't mind, I'll throw you a me update:
I'm done photo blogging. It was fun while it lasted but I'm out of good photos so back to writing. I'll continue keeping my [Flicker account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sketch22/) stocked with shiny visuals. Still wondering the streets of Kansas City. Currently working on some cool projects that I can't wait to share _more on those later_. I've been getting a lot of emails about Jupiter, my project management software. This has lead me to believe that I should finish that damn thing, soon. All is well for the most part.

The evolution of this site should be fun and interesting so stay tuned.
