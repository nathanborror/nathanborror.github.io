<h3>Saturday, April 30, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Time to chim in on Tiger. Dashboard, Spotlight, Automator, Oh My! I was worried at first, things were slow and hard drive was crankin'. Once Spotlight finished indexing my mess of over six years of files I breathed a sigh of relief.
Apple has posted a handy little Dashboard Programming Guide with all sorts of design guidlines and API info. They have done the same for Automator. This little app can save scary amounts of time.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/php-on-rails/>PHP on Rails</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, April 19, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Ruby buzz has been making its rounds these last few months. I&rsquo;m anxious to use Rails but my ISP nor my employer support it. So I&rsquo;ve been stuck staring at the colorful lollypop from a distance.
Cake may be the solution to my problems, at least until Ruby becomes more widely supported. Cake is a PHP framework based on the Rails design. It&rsquo;s still in its infancy but it looks pretty solid.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/selling-your-soul/>Selling Your Soul</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, April 13, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth with my colleagues regarding pre-built admin tools. My position has been the benefits of adopting a framework outweigh any off-the-shelf tool.
What is the difference between a framework and an off-the-shelf system? It&rsquo;s like buying fake plants instead of real ones. off-the-shelf products leave very little wiggle room for growth and are inevitably more than what you need. They also exhibit poor usability, with there shiny plastic leaves and all.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/soft-launch/>Soft Launch</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, April 12, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>This launch is softer than a baby&rsquo;s bum. Please excuse the possible broken links, sparse content, grayed out links, and unusually shaped big toe.
Things should be up to speed by the end of this week so keep checking back from time to time. Also, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll throw you a me update:
I&rsquo;m done photo blogging. It was fun while it lasted but I&rsquo;m out of good photos so back to writing.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2005/broken-window-theory/>Broken Window Theory</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, April 8, 2005</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve become a little obsessed with the &ldquo;Broken Window Theory.&rdquo; I was introduced to this theory by Travis and Charlie. Soon after, it began popping into my head at work, home, or while I was coding. Then I started noticing it in books and on the radio.
The theory is normally applied to urban decay and crime, however, it can be applied to almost anything. How did your apartment get so dirty?</p>
