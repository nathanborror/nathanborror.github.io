<p>Everyone should participate in a little people watching activities. It allows
you to jump out of your inner chaotic life and realize that you&rsquo;re not alone.
Now, there are a few keys to successful people watching. I&rsquo;ll share some of
mine, then you can pass yours along if you wish.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Avoid eye contact.</em> In order to remain a fly on the wall you must avoid eye
contact at all costs. After a while you begin to anticipate when someone will
look at you. This is a honed skill that comes with time and patients. A good
pair of sunglasses can help beginners.</li>
<li><em>Daydreaming is a side effect, and its Okay.</em> This allows you to &ldquo;figure stuff
out.&rdquo; In my opinion we don&rsquo;t daydream enough. We get so caught up in <em>doing</em>
and we forget <em>why.</em> Those are perfect moments to gain understanding with
the help of those around you.</li>
<li><em>Location is key.</em> I like coffee hang outs. Villages, Malls, Districts, or any
high traffic parts of your metropolis where eclecticism is prevalent. I prefer
a corner in midtown where coffee houses collide, a lonely clothing store
awaits hipsters, and bars are armed with dollar draws and outdoor patios. The
collage of people has the characteristics of a Rauschenberg
(<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=rauschenberg">http://images.google.com/images?q=rauschenberg</a>) exhibit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now its your turn. How, where, and why do you people watch? What strange stories
have you made up or overheard during your excursions? Do tell :)</p>
