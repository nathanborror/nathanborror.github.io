<p>Time to chim in on Tiger. Dashboard, Spotlight, Automator, Oh My! I was worried
at first, things were slow and hard drive was crankin'. Once Spotlight finished
indexing my mess of over six years of files I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Apple has posted a handy little <a href=http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_Tutorial/index.html>Dashboard Programming Guide</a>
with all sorts of design guidlines and API info. They have done the same for
<a href=http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/index.html>Automator</a>.
This little app can save scary amounts of time. BBEdit has realsed some nice
<a href=http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/bbeditautomatoractions.html>Actions</a>
in 8.2. Spotlight is the girl I never had. Once you program yourself to press
&ldquo;command-spacebar&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll never need that pesky finder dock icon. Still not sure
what to say about Safari RSS, its crashed about five times now. WebKit is
apparently much better but I have a feeling 10.4.1 will be a major bug fixer so
some may want to wait a week or two.</p>
<p>While there is some new eye candy, Tiger is all about saving time and becoming
more efficiant. Hopefully some of the philosophies will spill into other areas
of work.</p>
