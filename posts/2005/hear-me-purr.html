# Hear Me Purr

Time to chim in on Tiger. Dashboard, Spotlight, Automator, Oh My! I was worried at first, things were slow and hard drive was crankin'. Once Spotlight finished indexing my mess of over six years of files I breathed a sigh of relief.

Apple has posted a handy little [Dashboard Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_Tutorial/index.html) with all sorts of design guidlines and API info. They have done the same for [Automator.](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/AutomatorConcepts/index.html) This little app can save scary amounts of time. BBEdit has realsed some nice [Actions](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/bbeditautomatoractions.html) in 8.2. Spotlight is the girl I never had. Once you program yourself to press "command-spacebar" you'll never need that pesky finder dock icon. Still not sure what to say about Safari RSS, its crashed about five times now. WebKit is apparently much better but I have a feeling 10.4.1 will be a major bug fixer so some may want to wait a week or two.
While there is some new eye candy, Tiger is all about saving time and becoming more efficiant. Hopefully some of the philosophies will spill into other areas of work.
