<p>I spent last weekend learning Ruby on Rails (<a href=http://www.rubyonrails.com>http://www.rubyonrails.com</a>) and now
I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why the hell it took me so long. My work
(<a href=http://www.bradv.com>http://www.bradv.com</a>) was kind enough to fetch me a copy of Agile Web
Development with Rails (<a href=http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html>http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html</a>)
and I&rsquo;ve had a hard time focusing on anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already started porting some of my apps (<a href=http://glide.playgroundblues.com>http://glide.playgroundblues.com</a>)
to Rails and its surprisingly elegant and fun. After figuring out associations
between database tables I feel well on my way. There is still a lot to get used
to. Mainly Ruby&rsquo;s syntax. It&rsquo;s very different than any language I&rsquo;ve used. I&rsquo;m
really diggin' the &ldquo;everything is an object&rdquo; mentality.</p>
<p>Some tips if your interested&mldr; Install FastCGI
(<a href=http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/FastCGI%20on%20OS%20X)>http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/FastCGI%20on%20OS%20X)</a>. It will
dramatically increase the responsiveness of Ruby. Dreamhost has this option in
their panel. Be on the lookout for some MySQL issues
(<a href=http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/HowtoInstallOnOSXTiger>http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/HowtoInstallOnOSXTiger</a>) if your using
Tiger. Also make sure to point your VirtualHost entry to the /public folder in
your rails app. You could also do this with a .htaccess file in the root.</p>
<p>Be on the look out for a Rubified Playground Blues in the near future :)</p>
