For someone who reads fast and watches video at 2x I decided it would be fun to throw together a desktop version of Facebook between modules â€” the most \u003cstrong\u003eBORING\u003c/strong\u003e version possible with nothing fancy, just standard macOS components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisclaimer: This is just a fun exercise and a way for me to play with someone else\u0026rsquo;s building blocks. A lot goes in to how and why Facebook is the way it is today and teams of people are sweating the details.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you boil Facebook down it\u0026rsquo;s not \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e complicated. There are \u003cstrong\u003eA LOT\u003c/strong\u003e of interactions, but everything can pretty easily be assigned a component that\u0026rsquo;s super familiar to people. Below are basic replicas of News Feed, the Stories viewer and Messenger. The sidebar acts as a great home for most of the ever-growing navigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook-mini.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook-mini.png\" alt=\"Screenshots that depict Facebook as a desktop app. The main app includes feed and a sidebar navigation, another window shows chat and another shows how Stories would look.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe composer dropdown can show all the possible things a person can create, along with a clean interface for uploading photos and writing text posts. Sorta feels like sending an email ðŸ’Œ Unseen notifications and messages could persist in the right collapsable sidebar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook-compose.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook-compose.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Facebook as a desktop app with a right sidebar exposed showing notifications and a composer window on top of the main window.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings get super fun in Settings / Preferences. Facebook settings are notoriously complicated as the product has grown over the years. App settings have been an indicator for me how much a developer cares about their product and \u003ccode\u003e[cmd+,]\u003c/code\u003e is one of the first key commands I use after installing a new app. Most of Facebook\u0026rsquo;s settings can be organized well using standard layouts and components. It\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly clear how they all feel, probably because long-time Mac users are so familiar with these interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook-settings.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook-settings.png\" alt=\"Four screenshots showing different Facebook settings surfaces: general settings, security settings, privacy controls and notifications.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, here\u0026rsquo;s the basic interface, the thing we all end up scrolling most of the day. I like how boring it looks, how it puts more emphasis on content wile making it feel like it\u0026rsquo;s easier to navigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/screenshots/2021-04-08-macos-facebook.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of what a typical Facebook desktop experience could look like with a big photo taking center stage.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"takeaways\"\u003eTakeaways\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMulti-color iconography make an interface look too busy. The monochromatic and tint color strategy with macOS helps signify where interaction is possible while receding into background.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe density of macOS is something I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize I valued so much when compared to the latest version of Facebook where things seem way more spaced out than previous iterations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComponent libraries are kinda like alphabets, once you learn letters and grammar you can write great prose.
