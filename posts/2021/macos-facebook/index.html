<p>Had some free time during a long mandatory training session at work and started perusing Apple&rsquo;s <a href=https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#macos-apps>macOS Sketch file</a> with all the components that go into making a desktop app. I love imagining how components come together to form something useful 🤓</p>
<p>The training session I was enduring had minimum time limits. For someone who reads fast and watches video at 2x I decided it would be fun to throw together a desktop version of Facebook between modules — the most <strong>BORING</strong> version possible with nothing fancy, just standard macOS components.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This is just a fun exercise and a way for me to play with someone else&rsquo;s building blocks. A lot goes in to how and why Facebook is the way it is today and teams of people are sweating the details.</em></p>
<p>When you boil Facebook down it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> complicated. There are <strong>A LOT</strong> of interactions, but everything can pretty easily be assigned a component that&rsquo;s super familiar to people. Below are basic replicas of News Feed, the Stories viewer and Messenger. The sidebar acts as a great home for most of the ever-growing navigation.</p>

<p>The composer dropdown can show all the possible things a person can create, along with a clean interface for uploading photos and writing text posts. Sorta feels like sending an email 💌 Unseen notifications and messages could persist in the right collapsable sidebar.</p>

<p>Things get super fun in Settings / Preferences. Facebook settings are notoriously complicated as the product has grown over the years. App settings have been an indicator for me how much a developer cares about their product and <code>[cmd+,]</code> is one of the first key commands I use after installing a new app. Most of Facebook&rsquo;s settings can be organized well using standard layouts and components. It&rsquo;s surprisingly clear how they all feel, probably because long-time Mac users are so familiar with these interactions.</p>

<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s the basic interface, the thing we all end up scrolling most of the day. I like how boring it looks, how it puts more emphasis on content wile making it feel like it&rsquo;s easier to navigate.</p>

<h3 id=takeaways>Takeaways</h3>
<ol>
<li>Multi-color iconography make an interface look too busy. The monochromatic and tint color strategy with macOS helps signify where interaction is possible while receding into background.</li>
<li>The density of macOS is something I didn&rsquo;t realize I valued so much when compared to the latest version of Facebook where things seem way more spaced out than previous iterations.</li>
<li>Component libraries are kinda like alphabets, once you learn letters and grammar you can write great prose. Stability is key so people aren&rsquo;t constantly having to re-learn fundamentals.</li>
