<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2021/macos-facebook/>macOS Facebook</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, February 16, 2021</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Had some free time during a long mandatory training session at work and started perusing Apple&rsquo;s macOS Sketch file with all the components that go into making a desktop app. I love imagining how components come together to form something useful 🤓
The training session I was enduring had minimum time limits. For someone who reads fast and watches video at 2x I decided it would be fun to throw together a desktop version of Facebook between modules — the most BORING version possible with nothing fancy, just standard macOS components.</p>

Last Sunday I packed up all my running gear for another long and steep trail run. Nate recently acquired an old van from the 90s that would be our ride to Big Sur. Old vehicles kinda put me on edge but this one felt oddly familiar because growing up at Lake of the Ozarks we had a van like this so all kinds of memories were lighting up.</p>

Woke up around 5AM yesterday anxious to get on the trail. After some morning prep I walked outside to my car and immediately felt the cold air. Almost nine years of Northern California has decimated my resolve towards cold temperatures and there&rsquo;s only one way to warm up this morning!</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2015/blind-spots/>Blind spots</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, February 14, 2015</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Hours of my youth were lost to a game called Age of Empires. This game was crack cocaine for kids and should have been illegal in some states. Each new game plopped you in the middle of nowhere with an axe, a small hut and a goat or pig nearby. You could only see the little parcel of land around you, everything else was pitch black. As you wandered around the world revealed itself.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2015/self-driving-vagabonds/>Self-Driving Vagabonds</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, February 14, 2015</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>14 February 2015 — Self-driving cars are going to change the world — not many folks will disagree. It’s beginning to feel like our space race, the next leap towards a more efficient future. Google’s got prototypes, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have adaptive cruise control, Tesla almost has autopilot and Apple’s leaking.
Great, but these are baby steps when it comes to experience. Of course, solving the intelligence bit is really hard but the way we experience this future is where we’re gonna need to decide what type of world we want to live in.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2014/imitation-as-a-tool/>Imitation as a Tool</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, February 14, 2014</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>&ldquo;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve all heard this, it&rsquo;s how the level headed react to “copycats” or &ldquo;ripoffs.&rdquo; The truth is imitation is natural. We may not like to admit it but we&rsquo;re all skilled imitators. Without it there would be no way to talk with one another or possess similar value systems.
There&rsquo;s a famous chapter in Richard Dawkin&rsquo;s The Selfish Gene where he coins the term &lsquo;meme&rsquo; to explain a non-biological form of evolution — an evolution of culture from one &lsquo;survival machine&rsquo; to another.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2013/my-experience-learning-ios/>My experience learning iOS</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, October 9, 2013</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Twice while living in Kansas I attempted to learn Objective-C and Cocoa. Getting past the first few chapters was pretty mind numbing. It didn’t really have anything to do with the difficulty curve. I already knew other languages—Python, Javascript—and didn’t really have a reason to learn something else.
The third time I tried was early 2012 when I started reading iOS Programming. This time I needed a project or I’d fail yet again.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2013/obsolescence/>Obsolescence</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, April 27, 2013</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>We’ve witnessed a lot of products in our lifetimes. Some have faded away without even realizing it. Products like fax machines, AOL, desktop computers, atlases, home telephones. Sure, some of us still use these but they’ve all been replaced with better alternatives.
The best companies and people are capable of predicting when these shifts happen — some even have the capacity to obsolesce their own products. They understand if they don’t, someone else will.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2013/state-machine/>State Machine</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, March 3, 2013</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Last year Philips introduced Hue, a dead simple way to automate all your home lighting. After living with it for a few months and buying into Sonos — a wireless multi-room audio setup—I&rsquo;m beginning to realize how accessible home automation is becoming. They&rsquo;ve both forgotten one thing though, automation.
Automation is the use of machines, control systems and information technologies to optimize productivity in the production of goods and delivery of services.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2013/today/>Today</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, January 12, 2013</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been fond of arbitrary markers in time. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, they all seem odd to me and I&rsquo;ve never been one to celebrate them. Every day should be special and accomplishments, small and large should be relished, not random days.
As you would correctly suspect I don&rsquo;t do resolutions. But I do think constantly about a question Buckminster Fuller used to ask his grandson, &ldquo;What is the most important thing we could be thinking about today?</p>
