# iPhone bookmark iconage

If you're wondering how to control the icon that gets generated for your webpage with the new 1.1.3 iPhone release, look no further than [Apple's iPhone Dev Center](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/devcenter/designingcontent.html).

Apple has added a section called "Create a WebClip Bookmark Icon" and it calls for a 57x57 pixel icon. After some testing today I've concluded this recommended sizing results in a fuzzy icon, largely due to the iPhone being a 163 ppi display.

Instead of sticking with the recommended sizing I bumped it up to 158x158. When this gets scaled you'll be left with a crisp icon that sits nicely amongst Apples crisp icons. Onward.
