# Gadget fast

My iPhone and laptop will be unplugged starting Friday evening for two days. I've let the fog of distractions generated by these two devices grow too thick so for the next few days ([much like China](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/world/asia/15beijing.html?ex=1365998400&amp;en=dcf809d03fc3958e&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink)) they'll be turned off.

It doesn't stop there. The following week Twitter, Flickr, an my feed reader will be muted. I have nothing against these services, but it's time to step back and take the pulse of things around me and see if I'm missing something.

I used to do more gadget/service fasting and I'm well over due. My plan is to do some brainstorming for a few projects currently on my plate and catch up on some reading, but more importantly, spend time with my girlfriend.

See you all next week!
