<p>My iPhone and laptop will be unplugged starting Friday evening for two days. I&rsquo;ve let the fog of distractions generated by these two devices grow too thick so for the next few days they&rsquo;ll be turned off.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop there. The following week Twitter, Flickr, an my feed reader will be muted. I have nothing against these services, but it&rsquo;s time to step back and take the pulse of things around me and see if I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>
<p>I used to do more gadget/service fasting and I&rsquo;m well over due. My plan is to do some brainstorming for a few projects currently on my plate and catch up on some reading, but more importantly, spend time with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>See you all next week!</p>
