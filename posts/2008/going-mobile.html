# Going mobile

Over the weekend, I decided to whip up a mobile (iPhone) version of Playground Blues. I walked into Broadway Cafe around 3pm on Saturday, and by 5:30, I had [m.playgroundblues.com](http://m.playgroundblues.com). Here's how it went down.

## Step 1

Since I'm still using Dreamhost and FastCGI, I created my .htaccess file along with my dispatch.fcgi file for my new sub-domain as usual. Made one little change to my dispatch file: instead of having `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` pointing to playgroundblues.settings, I pointed it to playgroundblues.settings_mobile.
Then, in my project folder, I made a duplicate of my settings file and renamed it to settings_mobile.py. Let me emphasize again, this is a duplicate.

## Step 2

Created a new templates folder and named it "templates_mobile." Opened up my settings_mobile.py file and added a new line to the top of my <code>TEMPLATE_DIRS</code> tuple. This tells Django to first look in mobile templates, and if the template doesn't exist, fall back on regular site templates. (Remember, this is only for my mobile site.)

```python
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
  "/home/playgroundblues/templates_mobile/",
  "/home/playgroundblues/templates/",
)
```

## Step 3

In my new templates_mobile folder, I created a new base template called "base_mobile.html" which I'll use to extend in all my child templates instead of the main sites base.html. Then I went through the sites pages and recreated mirrored templates in the mobile folder. So /templates/blog/post_detail.html was overwritten by /templates_mobile/blog/post_detail.html. I stripped out extraneous content that was unnecessary for someone on the go, leaving core content and functionality.

The nice thing is if someone happens to creep into a section that you haven't gotten to (as long as you didn't override base.html), your site will display as it would on a computer proper. If there's a more succinct way of doing this, please let me know.
