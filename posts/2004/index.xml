The Faint &amp;ldquo;Wet From Birth&amp;rdquo; and Tom Waits &amp;ldquo;Real Gone&amp;rdquo; are so unbelievably necessary I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why you&amp;rsquo;re still reading. Go get them!
The Faint marches forward with its sexy themes and lucius lyrics. My uncertainties about how they would top Blank-Wave Arcade were shattered by the first track and continued to crumble through track two until they were disintegrated with &amp;ldquo;Southern Belles in London Sing.</description></item><item><title>Kansas City Migration</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kansas-city-migration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2004 12:59:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kansas-city-migration/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully migrated to Downtown Kansas City from Springfield. It took about a week to get all my stuff in order and my mind is catching up.
Tried Middle Eastern food for the first time, go Gyros! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had Chile Relleno I suggest you dart to a good Mexican restaurant and give it a taste.
The First Friday Art Walk happened to be last friday. Hammerpress unveiled their Christmas collection.</description></item><item><title>Yo La Weekend</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/yo-la-weekend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2004 13:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/yo-la-weekend/</guid><description>This weekend I saw Yo La Tengo for the first time in Kansas City. Definitely worth the bones if they&amp;rsquo;re in your area. Amazing jams and a really hot drummer girl. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them I recommend first getting &amp;ldquo;I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One&amp;rdquo; and then &amp;ldquo;Summer Sun.&amp;rdquo; If your hooked you&amp;rsquo;ll also like &amp;ldquo;And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.&amp;rdquo;
Also did a little apartment hunting before I begin playing/working with the fine lads at Look and Feel.</description></item><item><title>Rip Alvin iPod</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/rip-alvin-ipod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2004 19:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/rip-alvin-ipod/</guid><description>Today is a sad day. I went for a bike ride downtown and in a moment of braveness, tragedy struck. After making a successful jump from a very large curb a sense of accomplishment ended when my pedal clipped the curb halting my bike and catapulting me through the air. The silence that followed seemed to be more painful than my bleeding arm.
Alvin was a good iPod. The first generation of his time.</description></item><item><title>More Adventurous</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/more-adventurous/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2004 19:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/more-adventurous/</guid><description>About a year ago a friend of mine introduced me to a little world called Rilo Kiley. Her two albums, &amp;ldquo;Execution of All Things&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Takeoffs and Landings&amp;rdquo;, bring sunshine to a rainy day and lift you up to a place not often visited through music. Jenny Lewis&amp;rsquo;s voice never seems to grow old. They&amp;rsquo;re songs are so diverse and colorful.
I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t believe they could top their last two releases.</description></item><item><title>Jupiter</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/jupiter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2004 19:22:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/jupiter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce a new project of mine. It&amp;rsquo;s called Jupiter. Jupiter is a project management solution that began August 1, 2004 after heavy research. Roughly two months of ironing out the database scheme and functionality I&amp;rsquo;m ready to get feedback and suggestions. Keep in mind things are in the beginning stages and this is by no means a finished/polished product.
I was planning to provide a run down of all the bells and whistles but I think I would rather get everyones first impressions and go from there.</description></item><item><title>Textpattern Blues</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/textpattern-blues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2004 19:21:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/textpattern-blues/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly been warming up to Textpattern over the past few months. At the spur of the moment I purchased a nice little plot over at Dreamhost and starting some planting. I&amp;rsquo;m about finished tilling the land and beginning to plant some seeds, however, you might stumble across some rocky areas.
On another note, since when did IE6 not support min-width and max-width? Yet another disappointment handed down from the pearly white gates.</description></item><item><title>A Revolution of Education</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/a-revolution-of-education/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2004 19:21:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/a-revolution-of-education/</guid><description>I believe it&amp;rsquo;s time for a Education Revolution. While I may not be an expert in learning science I did participate in the Education system for 17 years and continue to work for an University.
Currently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General Education pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and so on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is wrong.</description></item><item><title>Heads or Tails</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/heads-or-tails/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2004 19:19:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/heads-or-tails/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been somewhat silent lately with a few whispers here and there. The past couple weeks have been very interesting, stressful to say the least. Job, home and personal changes.
After much thought and pondering I accepted a position at Southwest Missouri State University as Multimedia Producer. I bid a humble farewell to Neubix Studios. The gamut of knowledge and wisdom Ryan and I provided each other was priceless. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to have been apart of their transformation and growth.</description></item><item><title>Inspirational Journeys</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/inspirational-journeys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2004 13:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/inspirational-journeys/</guid><description>In 1947 sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski, moved too Thunder Mountain. He constructed a 741 foot staircase to the peak of the Mountain to begin, with his lone jackhammer, possibly the worlds largest sculpture, Crazy Horse. For the next 33 years he chipped away at the mammoth mountain side until his death.
His eye is 12 feet wide, his outstretched arm the length of a subway train. And by the time his horse is finished, we&amp;rsquo;ll all be dead.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Lack</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/wireless-lack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2004 13:11:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/wireless-lack/</guid><description>Today my coffee house was closed for the holiday. If you could only see the look on my face. It seems to be the only downside to holidays. This didn&amp;rsquo;t detour me from finding a hotspot that provided legally addictive &amp;ldquo;stimulants.&amp;rdquo;
After much driving my choices were narrowed down to Starbucks and Panera. Starbucks uses T-mobile for wifi which costs money so I chose Panera with its free wifi provided by QGO.</description></item><item><title>Far from Modest</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/far-from-modest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2004 19:21:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/far-from-modest/</guid><description>Has anyone else really listened to the lyrics on the new Modest Mouse album? For lack of better words, they&amp;rsquo;re amazing.
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. Adding their breeze to the summer nights. Outside water like air was great. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I had that day. Walk a little farther to another plan. You said that you did, but you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. â€” The World At Large</description></item><item><title>Kottke Critique</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kottke-critique/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2004 19:05:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kottke-critique/</guid><description>Jason Kottke recently released the next incarnation of Kottke.org. I must say, even though visually things are very similar to the previous version, Jason has done an excellent job of perfecting his structure and usability.
Jason&amp;rsquo;s text dominant design reminds us of the power of typography. His subtle choices of font sizes, weights, leading and link color are methodically chosen along with simple dividers to create a harmonious feel. From the looks of things the famous green header has been on the Atkins diet.</description></item><item><title>Fragile Sunday</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/fragile-sunday/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2004 19:35:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/fragile-sunday/</guid><description>Sunday&amp;rsquo;s are supposed to invite rest and relaxation, however, this was like no other Sunday I anticipated. Saturday evening was great. I stumbled upon a public showing of Waking Life in an old art studio downtown. We enjoyed tea and sat on a variety of vintage chairs watching one of my favorite films. Afterwards I was feeling very reflective and philosophical so I read some and went to bed early.</description></item><item><title>Someone Find The Cat</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/someone-find-the-cat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2004 19:04:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/someone-find-the-cat/</guid><description>Why do we still have mice? Seriously, haven&amp;rsquo;t we reached the point in computer evolution where we can discard the mouse completely? Modern operating systems have the ability to solely rely on voice commands, pen devices and touch screens. Why is it taking us so long to rid ourselves of a device that is responsible for such a painful syndrome.
Mice are a thing of the past, much like CRT monitors, parallel ports, walkmans and even the compact disc.</description></item><item><title>Textpattern Flow</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/textpattern-flow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2004 19:03:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/textpattern-flow/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to pose a question to my readers that use Textpattern. Last week I noticed Jon Hicks switched over which sparked my interest. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to switch over to a PHP based system for a while and from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Textpattern is very nice. One of my issues is how to structure my content using the Section, Category, Page, etc. method that Textpattern uses. Can anyone out there provide an example or input on how they achieved a solid architecture?</description></item><item><title>Rise of the Documentary</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/rise-of-the-documentary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2004 21:39:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/rise-of-the-documentary/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a connoisseur of documentary film and rarely do I read fiction opposed to non-fiction. Learning about the actions and habits of society, whether opinionated or not, has always intrigued me. It appears documentary film is rising in popularity. Not surprising due to the rise of Reality TV, they fit right in. Documentaries have allowed those with a story and small voice to speak aloud. Unfortunately, unless you live in a big city you may never get a chance to listen.</description></item><item><title>Flipping Zines</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/flipping-zines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2004 19:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/flipping-zines/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bone to pick with design magazines. I used to buy them frequently based on issue topics. I never subscribe, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to confine myself to one magazine; sounds weird, deal with it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased any new issues in about four months due to the overwhelming amount of advertisements. No-longer can you &amp;ldquo;flip&amp;rdquo; through these magazines without getting stuck on paper company ads or booklets on Adobe.</description></item><item><title>Stopdesign Critique</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/stopdesign-critique/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2004 19:03:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/stopdesign-critique/</guid><description>I felt like revisiting Douglas Bowman&amp;rsquo;s Stopdesign since my previous critique was premature. Douglas did a fine job on many fronts. The architecture is a three column joy. Strategic attention was given to the front page where a great deal of content is displayed without overloading your eye. The subtle use of color to distinguish a hierarchy makes this possible. As you dig deeper content expands to a two column layout.</description></item><item><title>Gmail Big Brother</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/gmail-big-brother/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2004 21:37:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/gmail-big-brother/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering what angle Google planned to take with its new Gmail service, currently in beta form. After some reading it all makes perfect sense. Google will offer 1GB of email space in return for the ability to scan your messages and place ads based on the content. After the excitement of 1GB wears, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to wonder if the trade off is morally right?
Example: I receive an email regarding a relatives grave health problems; to the right ads are displayed regarding funeral homes.</description></item><item><title>Stopdesign and Mezzoblue Critique</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/stopdesign-and-mezzoblue-critique/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2004 21:27:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/stopdesign-and-mezzoblue-critique/</guid><description>I hope the following designers don&amp;rsquo;t mind my friendly critique (they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, design is meant to be critiqued).
Douglas Bowman of Stopdesign recently &amp;ldquo;ditched&amp;rdquo; his styles and &amp;ldquo;start[ed] over with a blank slate.&amp;rdquo; I immediately noticed the identity. Very well done. The new mark is reminiscent of the previous, however, this one is fresher and more bold. The type treatment on the logo is quite interesting as well. Playful but doesn&amp;rsquo;t set itself apart from the mark.</description></item><item><title>Lapsang Souchong</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/lapsang-souchong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2004 21:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/lapsang-souchong/</guid><description>This weekend was very rejuvenating. The weather was beautiful and the town was minus over 5,000 college students. Campus was a ghost town, perfect for a little amateur skateboarding. Downtown was pretty desolate as well. Sunny weather invited me to do some outdoor sketching at the square. I drove by my future apartment enough to give my soon-to-be neighbors the impression of a stalker. Added a new Black Tea to my collection called Lapsang Souchong, it smells like campfire.</description></item><item><title>Truth Beauty Power</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/truth-beauty-power/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2004 21:24:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/truth-beauty-power/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Studies In Design by Christopher Dresser. The book was initially published in 1875 as an inspirational guide for designers. Dresser was most notable for his contributions to the Victorian era with his intricately designed textiles, furniture and ceramics. The following are passages I felt like sharing.
Decorations, to be satisfying to the educated, must manifest knowledge&amp;hellip; for unless the decoration is done wisely as well as with understanding , it may yet fail to please those who are best able to appreciate good ornament.</description></item><item><title>Lukova Exhibition</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/lukova-exhibition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2004 21:24:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/lukova-exhibition/</guid><description>Recently Luba Lukova graced our local Art and Design Gallery with some of her current works and sketches. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of her style and philosophy. She currently teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
Her unique style focuses on metaphorical references, manipulation of the human form and she uses a very unique treatment of typography. I was able to snap some photos to share with you.</description></item><item><title>Quicksilver Revolution</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/quicksilver-revolution/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2004 21:22:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/quicksilver-revolution/</guid><description>As soon as I realized something was flirting with perfection I discover it gets even better. Over the past three years I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced Mac OS X evolve into, in my opinion, the most effective operating system on the planet. This revolution has spawned many enhancing third party applications. After reading the hype about Quicksilver I finally gave it some attention. Seconds after installing my jaw dropped.
I take my laptop everywhere and its my sole computer.</description></item><item><title>Gleaming the Cube</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/gleaming-the-cube/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2004 19:37:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/gleaming-the-cube/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been brushing up on my skills as a skateboarder behind a local Italian Restaurant. It began in my friends basement when we found a beat up skateboard during a regular weekend gathering. This sparked our interest further so we ended up buying some generic boards from a local skate shop. They were black underneath and screaming for artwork.
Last weekend we bought some spray paint (hot pink is unbelievably hard to find) and mylar.</description></item><item><title>A Modern Experience</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/a-modern-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2004 21:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/a-modern-experience/</guid><description>The Guggenheim in Manhattan recently had an Exhibition entitled &amp;ldquo;Singular Forms (Sometimes Repeated)&amp;rdquo; Art from 1951 to the Present. Not your typical exhibition where you study lavish master works. The topic was Minimalism and, at first, I was somewhat timid; this being my virgin modernist exhibition. I began reading the blocks of text describing each piece while the people next too me stared hopelessly into blank canvases. I was fascinated.</description></item><item><title>Back and Changed Forever</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/back-and-changed-forever/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2004 19:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/back-and-changed-forever/</guid><description>Back from Manhattan and feeling refreshed. Later this week I plan to post some photos and audio from the trip. Pending on how much stuff awaits me at work.
Some highlights include a group chat with Milton Glaser and Mirko Ilic, an exhibition by Christopher Dresser, East Village, Greenwich Village, SoHo, Fashion District, Upright Citizens Brigade, indy galleries, cafes in the morning, comic book and vintage book stores, walking with no direction, pizza and subway entertainment.</description></item><item><title>First Things First</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/first-things-first/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2004 19:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/first-things-first/</guid><description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering many questions regarding my place as a designer. I feel I may have lost sight of certain goals which have lead me to question my purpose. Design will always be my first love, however, I need to be true to that which I love.
I spent time last night rereading The First Things First Manifesto. I recommend FTF to all designers, for it will stir up the same questions floating around in my head.</description></item><item><title>Kinetic Art</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kinetic-art/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2004 13:06:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kinetic-art/</guid><description>Over the weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for my trip to Manhattan that is taking place next week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading up on some new artists and refreshing myself on Art History because it makes the gallery and museum experience much more enjoyable when you have some knowledge behind what your looking at.
I came across one of my favorite artists that always seems to capture my attention. Alexander Calder&amp;rsquo;s mobiles are so fascinating to me and I always seem to stumble upon them in museums.</description></item><item><title>Indy Support</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/indy-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2004 13:08:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/indy-support/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been distancing myself from &amp;ldquo;corporate america.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to completely do unless your Ted Kaczynski but even he had to buy stamps. (Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to get weird Google referrals on Ted Kaczynski). Anyway, I have good reason for choosing this direction.
My family has a history of entrepreneurs that range from a Grandfather that sold &amp;ldquo;Nimrods&amp;rdquo; to a mom that makes and sells women&amp;rsquo;s clothing. This compels me to spend an extra dollar here and there in support of other entrepreneurs.</description></item><item><title>Not So Lucky</title><link>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/not-so-lucky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2004 19:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://nathan.run/posts/2004/not-so-lucky/</guid><description>In response to my good friend Ryan&amp;rsquo;s entry on iTunes I&amp;rsquo;d just like to say I haven&amp;rsquo;t won a single song with that Pepsi promo. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s just bad luck or I just don&amp;rsquo;t drink enough Pepsi.

It&amp;rsquo;s a very charming piece of hardware. I&amp;rsquo;ve already gone through two of the regular Apple Pro mice. I have a tendency of wrapping the cord around the mouse when I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;on the go&amp;rdquo; and eventually the wire inside breaks. However they&amp;rsquo;ve been good to me and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve been very pleased with the Bluetooth derivative.

Once thats over I&amp;rsquo;m going to get back on the learning train. Cutting back on entertainment television, movies and other distractions. Time to get down to business.

I saw the preview and sort of knew what I was getting myself into. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be an uplifting movie but I could tell these people had something to say. Some parts were hard to digest and some really made me question how I treat and view other people.

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether he was saying it before Nike but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to &amp;ldquo;just do it.&amp;rdquo;
We all have these lists of things we want to do in life. Things we want to accomplish, practice, learn, experience. We recall the list in our day dreams but loose sight of how easy it is to &amp;ldquo;just do it.</description></item></channel></rss>
