# Textpattern Flow

I'd like to pose a question to my readers that use Textpattern. Last week I noticed [Jon Hicks](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk) switched over which sparked my interest. I've been meaning to switch over to a PHP based system for a while and from what I've seen [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com) is very nice. One of my issues is how to structure my content using the Section, Category, Page, etc. method that Textpattern uses. Can anyone out there provide an example or input on how they achieved a solid architecture?
