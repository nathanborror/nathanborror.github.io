<p>I felt like revisiting Douglas Bowman&rsquo;s <a href=http://www.stopdesign.com/>Stopdesign</a>
since my previous critique was premature. Douglas did a fine job on many fronts.
The architecture is a three column joy. Strategic attention was given to the
front page where a great deal of content is displayed without overloading your
eye. The subtle use of color to distinguish a hierarchy makes this possible. As
you dig deeper content expands to a two column layout. The right bar is like a
companion at your side always informing you of relevant and/or alternate links.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of iconography. Douglas does a fine job at paying close
attention to icons that not only add detail but inform. It&rsquo;s very important to
have a method or reason behind everything and his icons express whether you&rsquo;re
about to view a document, comment, click away or click into the site.</p>
<p>With each section there is a drastically different look utilizing blurred images
and color, however the structure stays consistent. I&rsquo;ve heard some say this is
too drastic and it&rsquo;s hard for me to decide. I enjoy the distinct difference
between the <a href=http://www.stopdesign.com/portfolio/>portfolio</a> and the <a href=http://www.stopdesign.com/log/>log</a>. It bluntly informs you these are completely
different sections and could act alone. This shows versatility and it&rsquo;s
something you don&rsquo;t expect which can be startling but in the long run,
effective.</p>
<p>Well done Mr. Bowman. Take a bow.</p>
