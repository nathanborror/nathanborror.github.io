<p>I&rsquo;ve slowly been warming up to Textpattern over the past few months. At the spur
of the moment I purchased a nice little plot over at <a href=http://www.dreamhost.com>Dreamhost</a> and starting some planting. I&rsquo;m about finished
tilling the land and beginning to plant some seeds, however, you might stumble
across some rocky areas.</p>
<p>On another note, since when did IE6 not support min-width and max-width? Yet
another disappointment handed down from the pearly white gates. If anyone knows
a fix for this chime in please.</p>
