<p>Last night two new albums pitched a tent on my &ldquo;oh my god&rdquo; list of music. <a href=http://www.thefaint.com>The Faint</a> &ldquo;Wet From Birth&rdquo; and <a href=http://www.officialtomwaits.com>Tom Waits</a> &ldquo;Real Gone&rdquo; are so unbelievably necessary I don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;re still reading. Go get them!</p>
<p>The Faint marches forward with its sexy themes and lucius lyrics. My
uncertainties about how they would top <em>Blank-Wave Arcade</em> were shattered by the first track and continued to crumble through track two until they were disintegrated with &ldquo;Southern Belles in London Sing.&rdquo; Each track presents a unique personality ranging from violin accompaniment to a melodic choir of female vocals. Plus you can&rsquo;t beat an album that has a song entitled &ldquo;Erection.&rdquo; (no pun intended).</p>
<p>As for Mr. Waits&mldr; Waits challenges the human ear with his contorted vocals and crafted percussion. <em>Real Gone</em> takes you on an unforgettable journey of bizarre scenarios none of which are completely comprehendible. Light a cigar, pour some whisky, press play and put a note on the door, &ldquo;Real Gone.&rdquo;</p>
