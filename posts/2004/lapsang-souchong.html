# Lapsang Souchong

This weekend was very rejuvenating. The weather was beautiful and the town was minus over 5,000 college students. [Campus](http://www.missouristate.edu/) was a ghost town, perfect for a little amateur skateboarding. [Downtown](http://www.simplydowntown.com) was pretty desolate as well. Sunny weather invited me to do some outdoor sketching at the square. I drove by my future apartment enough to give my soon-to-be neighbors the impression of a stalker. Added a new Black Tea to my collection called [Lapsang Souchong](http://eat.epicurious.com/dictionary/food/index.ssf?DEF_ID=2468), it smells like campfire.

That was my weeend, tell me about yours?
