# Textpattern Blues

I've slowly been warming up to Textpattern over the past few months. At the spur of the moment I purchased a nice little plot over at [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) and starting some planting. I'm about finished tilling the land and beginning to plant some seeds, however, you might stumble across some rocky areas.

On another note, since when did IE6 not support min-width and max-width? Yet another disappointment handed down from the pearly white gates. If anyone knows a fix for this chime in please.
