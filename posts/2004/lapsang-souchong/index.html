<p>This weekend was very rejuvenating. The weather was beautiful and the town was minus over 5,000 college students. <a href=http://www.missouristate.edu/>Campus</a> was a ghost town, perfect for a little amateur skateboarding. <a href=http://www.simplydowntown.com>Downtown</a> was pretty desolate as well. Sunny weather invited me to do some outdoor sketching at the square. I drove by my future apartment enough to give my soon-to-be neighbors the impression of a stalker. Added a new Black Tea to my collection called <a href="http://eat.epicurious.com/dictionary/food/index.ssf?DEF_ID=2468">Lapsang Souchong</a>, it smells like campfire.</p>
