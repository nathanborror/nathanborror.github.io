<p>This weekend I went to see Monster. I saw the preview and sort of knew what I was getting myself into. It wasn&rsquo;t going to be an uplifting movie but I could tell these people had something to say. Some parts were hard to digest and some really made me question how I treat and view other people. It&rsquo;s a movie that needs to be scene with an open mind and heart. Charlize Theron deserves high recognition for pouring her soul into this film.</p>
