# Flipping Zines

I've got a bone to pick with design magazines. I used to buy them frequently based on issue topics. I never subscribe, mainly because I don't want to confine myself to one magazine; sounds weird, deal with it. I haven't purchased any new issues in about four months due to the overwhelming amount of advertisements. No-longer can you "flip" through these magazines without getting stuck on paper company ads or booklets on Adobe. The great importance of advertising is understood, however, I just find the current state of ads intrusive to my magazine reading experience. Also noticed is increased diluted content and for these reasons I have ceased my consumption of [HOW](http://www.howdesign.com), [Communication Arts](http://www.commarts.com), [Print](http://www.printmag.com/) and [Step](http://www.stepinsidedesign.com).

Until they redeem themselves I'm filling my "flipping" void with [Res](http://www.res.com/), [Wire](http://www.thewire.co.uk/), [Tokion](http://tokion.com/), [Wad](http://www.wadmag.com/), [Idn](http://www.idnworld.com/), [Colors](http://www.colorsmagazine.com/) and [Metropolis](http://www.metropolismag.com/). These selections aren't solely devoted to design but I've found reading about film, music, culture, fashion, art, and architecture to be much more inspiring.
