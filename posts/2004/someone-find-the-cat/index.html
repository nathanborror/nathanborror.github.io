<p>Why do we still have mice? Seriously, haven&rsquo;t we reached the point in computer
evolution where we can discard the mouse completely? <a href=http://www.apple.com/macosx/>Modern operating systems</a> have the ability to solely rely on voice
commands, pen devices and touch screens. Why is it taking us so long to rid
ourselves of a device that is responsible for such a <a href=http://familydoctor.org/023.xml>painful syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>Mice are a thing of the past, much like CRT monitors, parallel ports, walkmans
and even the compact disc. It&rsquo;s time to let go, look to the future of usability
and functionality. For regular users (i.e. email, word processing, chatting,
etc.) the absence of the mouse would be an easier transition, however, the
utilization of a pen device would have to be retained for web browsing and other
tasks that utilize buttons or links too small for fingers to press.</p>
<p>I believe that direct interaction with a surface that provides feedback can be a
very positive experience for the user. You become more involved in the activity
at hand rather than indirectly moving a mouse around and arbitrarily clicking. I
long for the day when my sketchbook uploads to my laptop, logging my daily ideas
where I can call them up based on day, keywords, project or mood.</p>
