# Rise of the Documentary

I've always been a connoisseur of documentary film and rarely do I read fiction opposed to non-fiction. Learning about the actions and habits of society, whether opinionated or not, has always intrigued me. It appears documentary film is rising in popularity. Not surprising due to the rise of Reality TV, they fit right in. Documentaries have allowed those with a story and small voice to speak aloud. Unfortunately, unless you live in a big city you may never get a chance to listen. Some documentaries on the horizon include:

- [Mayor of the Sunset Strip](http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/mayorofthesunsetstrip.html)
- [The Agronomist](http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/the_agronomist.html)
