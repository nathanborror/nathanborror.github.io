# Lukova Exhibition

Recently [Luba Lukova](http://lubalukova.home.att.net/LubaLukovaStudio.html) graced our local Art and Design Gallery with some of her current works and sketches. I've always been a fan of her style and philosophy. She currently teaches at the [School of Visual Arts](http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/) in Manhattan.

Her unique style focuses on metaphorical references, manipulation of the human form and she uses a very unique treatment of typography. I was able to snap some photos to share with you.
