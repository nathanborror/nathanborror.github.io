# Not So Lucky


In response to my good friend [Ryan's](http://www.justwatchthesky.com) entry on iTunes I'd just like to say I haven't won a single song with that Pepsi promo. I guess it's just bad luck or I just don't drink enough Pepsi. I bought a Sierra Mist today and thought for sure I'd win but instead I was presented with "Please try again."

Anyone want a first generation iPod? I'm selling it for 50 bucks, 75 with an iTrip. Works just fine, I just need a larger one.
