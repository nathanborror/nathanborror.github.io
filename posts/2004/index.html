<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/double-the-pleasure/>Double the Pleasure</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, November 7, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Last night two new albums pitched a tent on my &ldquo;oh my god&rdquo; list of music. The Faint &ldquo;Wet From Birth&rdquo; and Tom Waits &ldquo;Real Gone&rdquo; are so unbelievably necessary I don&rsquo;t even know why you&rsquo;re still reading. Go get them!
The Faint marches forward with its sexy themes and lucius lyrics. My uncertainties about how they would top Blank-Wave Arcade were shattered by the first track and continued to crumble through track two until they were disintegrated with &ldquo;Southern Belles in London Sing.</p>

<h3>Saturday, November 6, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve successfully migrated to Downtown Kansas City from Springfield. It took about a week to get all my stuff in order and my mind is catching up.
Tried Middle Eastern food for the first time, go Gyros! If you haven&rsquo;t had Chile Relleno I suggest you dart to a good Mexican restaurant and give it a taste.
The First Friday Art Walk happened to be last friday. Hammerpress unveiled their Christmas collection.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/yo-la-weekend/>Yo La Weekend</a></h2>
<h3>Monday, October 4, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>This weekend I saw Yo La Tengo for the first time in Kansas City. Definitely worth the bones if they&rsquo;re in your area. Amazing jams and a really hot drummer girl. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them I recommend first getting &ldquo;I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Summer Sun.&rdquo; If your hooked you&rsquo;ll also like &ldquo;And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.&rdquo;
Also did a little apartment hunting before I begin playing/working with the fine lads at Look and Feel.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/rip-alvin-ipod/>Rip Alvin iPod</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, September 29, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Today is a sad day. I went for a bike ride downtown and in a moment of braveness, tragedy struck. After making a successful jump from a very large curb a sense of accomplishment ended when my pedal clipped the curb halting my bike and catapulting me through the air. The silence that followed seemed to be more painful than my bleeding arm.
Alvin was a good iPod. The first generation of his time.</p>

<h3>Tuesday, September 28, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>About a year ago a friend of mine introduced me to a little world called Rilo Kiley. Her two albums, &ldquo;Execution of All Things&rdquo; and &ldquo;Takeoffs and Landings&rdquo;, bring sunshine to a rainy day and lift you up to a place not often visited through music. Jenny Lewis&rsquo;s voice never seems to grow old. They&rsquo;re songs are so diverse and colorful.
I honestly didn&rsquo;t believe they could top their last two releases.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/jupiter/>Jupiter</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, September 26, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to introduce a new project of mine. It&rsquo;s called Jupiter. Jupiter is a project management solution that began August 1, 2004 after heavy research. Roughly two months of ironing out the database scheme and functionality I&rsquo;m ready to get feedback and suggestions. Keep in mind things are in the beginning stages and this is by no means a finished/polished product.
I was planning to provide a run down of all the bells and whistles but I think I would rather get everyones first impressions and go from there.</p>

<h3>Thursday, September 9, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve slowly been warming up to Textpattern over the past few months. At the spur of the moment I purchased a nice little plot over at Dreamhost and starting some planting. I&rsquo;m about finished tilling the land and beginning to plant some seeds, however, you might stumble across some rocky areas.
On another note, since when did IE6 not support min-width and max-width? Yet another disappointment handed down from the pearly white gates.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/a-revolution-of-education/>A Revolution of Education</a></h2>
<h3>Saturday, September 4, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s time for a Education Revolution. While I may not be an expert in learning science I did participate in the Education system for 17 years and continue to work for an University.
Currently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General Education pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and so on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is wrong.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/heads-or-tails/>Heads or Tails</a></h2>
<h3>Thursday, September 2, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been somewhat silent lately with a few whispers here and there. The past couple weeks have been very interesting, stressful to say the least. Job, home and personal changes.
After much thought and pondering I accepted a position at Southwest Missouri State University as Multimedia Producer. I bid a humble farewell to Neubix Studios. The gamut of knowledge and wisdom Ryan and I provided each other was priceless. I&rsquo;m grateful to have been apart of their transformation and growth.</p>

<h3>Sunday, July 18, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>In 1947 sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski, moved too Thunder Mountain. He constructed a 741 foot staircase to the peak of the Mountain to begin, with his lone jackhammer, possibly the worlds largest sculpture, Crazy Horse. For the next 33 years he chipped away at the mammoth mountain side until his death.
His eye is 12 feet wide, his outstretched arm the length of a subway train. And by the time his horse is finished, we&rsquo;ll all be dead.</p>
