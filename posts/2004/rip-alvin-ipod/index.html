<p>Today is a sad day. I went for a bike ride downtown and in a moment of
braveness, tragedy struck. After making a successful jump from a very large curb
a sense of accomplishment ended when my pedal clipped the curb halting my bike
and catapulting me through the air. The silence that followed seemed to be more
painful than my bleeding arm.</p>
<p>Alvin was a good iPod. The first generation of his time. He provided me with listening pleasure and
inspiration through many important moments during the past two and a half years.
One of my favorite moments was when I got lost in East Village, Manhattan. Never
once did I feel scared because Alvin always kept me in <a href=http://www.brokensocialscene.com/>good spirits</a>. I will miss you Alvin iPod. Rest in peace
my good friend. Oh, <a href=http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/>iTrip</a>
says goodbye too.</p>
