<p><a href=http://www.kottke.org/about>Jason Kottke</a> recently released the next
incarnation of <a href=http://www.kottke.org>Kottke.org</a>. I must say, even though
visually things are very similar to the previous version, Jason has done an
excellent job of perfecting his structure and usability.</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s text dominant design reminds us of the power of typography. His subtle
choices of font sizes, weights, leading and link color are methodically chosen
along with simple dividers to create a harmonious feel. From the looks of things
the famous green header has been on the Atkins diet. It may have slimmed up a
bit but it&rsquo;s just enough to remind you, This Is Kottke.</p>
<p>Kottke tweaked the two column layout, widening the left column a bit. I&rsquo;ve
always enjoyed the way Jason nestles his daily links into his blog column. This
works exceptionally well from a usability standpoint and gives the links more
attention in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>From the comments form (<a href=http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/06/5909.html>http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/06/5909.html</a>) to the
photo gallery (<a href=http://www.kottke.org/photos/highline0204/index.html>http://www.kottke.org/photos/highline0204/index.html</a>) and beyond
you can tell that a lot of care and thought went into every element of this
redesign. Well done Jason, take a bow.</p>
