# Yo La Weekend

This weekend I saw [Yo La Tengo](http://www.yolatengo.com) for the first time in Kansas City. Definitely worth the bones if they're in your area. Amazing jams and a really hot drummer girl. If you're not familiar with them I recommend first getting "I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One" and then "Summer Sun." If your hooked you'll also like "And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out."

Also did a little apartment hunting before I begin playing/working with the [fine](http://www.alwayscurious.com) [lads](http://www.squidfingers.com) at [Look and Feel](http://www.lookandfeel.com). I'm very excited and I'm sure I'll have many adventures to post in the coming months ;)
