# The Reading Trail

I'll be finishing up the Da Vinci Code tonight. Once thats over I'm going to get back on the learning train. Cutting back on entertainment television, movies and other distractions. Time to get down to business.

I've decided to sharpen my skills as an Information Architect. I've always enjoyed the organization of large amounts of data and felt like I was pretty good at it. However, I feel there is much more to learn.

My first selection will be a classic, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R. Tufte. Scientific American describes it as, "original, beautifully presented, sharp and learned, this book is a work of art. The art here is cognitive art, the graphic display of relations and empirical data, now an indispensable tool of science and engineering."

I'll be sure to post a review when I'm finished.
