# Kansas City Migration

I've successfully migrated to Downtown Kansas City from Springfield. It took about a week to get all my stuff in order and my mind is catching up.

Tried Middle Eastern food for the first time, go Gyros! If you haven't had Chile Relleno I suggest you dart to a good Mexican restaurant and give it a taste.
The First Friday Art Walk happened to be last friday. [Hammerpress](http://www.hammerpress.net) unveiled their Christmas collection. The work is top notch. If you haven't flipped the newest [Print Mag](http://www.printmag.com) I suggest you earmark Missouri, watch out [Art Chantry](http://gigposters.com/designers.php?designer).
