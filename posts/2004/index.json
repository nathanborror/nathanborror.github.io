While I may not be an expert in \nlearning science I did participate in the Education system for 17 years and \ncontinue to work for an University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General \nEducation pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and \nso on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is \nwrong. Students shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be pressured into learning anything. During my \nfreshman year in college I despised going to my Physical Education class because \nit was so boring and a waste of my time and effort. However, I now realize the \npositive affects exercise can have in my life and work. This is where the \nproblem lies. That course should have excited me about the affects that physical \nactivity can bring to my desired goals in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents learn best when motivated, when they care. They need to be \nemotionally involved, to be drawn to the excitement of the topic. Learning\u003cbr\u003e\nneed not be a dull or dreary exercise, not even learning about what are \nnormally considered dull and dreary topics: every topic can be made exciting, \nevery topic excites the emotions of someone, so why not excite everyone?\n\u0026ndash; Donald Norman, Emotional Design\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if we broke down the barriers of Education. Instead of offering courses we \nenrolled in what I\u0026rsquo;ll call Communities. Each Community would have a focus: Art, \nScience, Mathematics; within each community Groups, with related focuses, would \nform. For example the Art Community would have a Group which focuses on Design \nor Pottery. The students of these communities would not organize in classrooms \nnor would they participate in courses. Each Community would reside in its very \nown research library. I use the term library loosely because the environment \nwould need to cater to a wide variety of situations: discussion, research, \nbuilding, brainstorming, and so on. Each student would draft goals for \nthemselves, for the Group, and for the Community. Within the Communities \nprofessors would apply general education discussions based on the goals of the \nCommunity. Students need to learn History so the Communities promote learning \nabout the Middle Ages and how it relates to the students individual goals, there \nby validating its importance to the overall purpose of the Community. Students \nwould then begin to realize how imperative it is to understand not just one \nsubject, but all subjects in relation to their goals thereby creating a well \nrounded diverse society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is time for lessons to become alive, for history to be seen as a human \nstruggle, for students to understand and appreciate the structure of art, \nmusic, science, and mathematics. How can these topics be made exciting? By \nmaking them relevant to the lives of each individual student.\n\u0026ndash; Donald Norman, Emotional Design\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducation is the cornerstone of society. Without Education society breaks down. \nAs we grow and mature throughout our life we should never cease to learn. Our \nEducation institutions must promote life long learning rather than handing out \ndiplomas and saying next. While this idea may or may not succeed I feel it\u0026rsquo;s \nimportant to continually evolve our methods of teaching and learning in order to \nevolve as a society. With that in mind I invite your thoughts and criticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"Heads or Tails","date_published":"2004-09-02T19:19:00-0800","date_modified":"2004-09-02T19:19:00-0800","id":"https://nathan.run/2004/heads-or-tails/","url":"https://nathan.run/2004/heads-or-tails/","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been somewhat silent lately with a few whispers here and there.
