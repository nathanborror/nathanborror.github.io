<p>Today my coffee house was closed for the holiday. If you could only see the look on my face. It seems to be the only downside to holidays. This didn&rsquo;t detour me from finding a hotspot that provided legally addictive &ldquo;stimulants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much driving my choices were narrowed down to Starbucks and Panera. Starbucks uses T-mobile for wifi which costs money so I chose Panera with its free wifi provided by <a href=http://www.goqgo.com/>QGO</a>.</p>
<p>After realizing this isn&rsquo;t the crowd I&rsquo;m used too I found a nice little spot in the corner to get down to business. I was first presented with a Panera screen in my browser asking me to agree with its Wi-Fi Terms. After reading over the four page document and knowing that all rights to privacy will be infringed upon I clicked Agree and went on my way. I must note, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve had to do this ever, anywhere. I hear its the same way at Starbucks but I&rsquo;ve grown accustom to independent shops that don&rsquo;t care what you do while respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>Needless to say Panera&rsquo;s wifi is very slow and, privacy aside, not worth it due to their lack of coffee making abilities. I hope more free hotspots open up. I&rsquo;ve never understood why places charge for wifi, it&rsquo;s very cheep for the store to provide and attracts customers.</p>
