<p>I&rsquo;ve got a bone to pick with design magazines. I used to buy them frequently based on issue topics. I never subscribe, mainly because I don&rsquo;t want to confine myself to one magazine; sounds weird, deal with it. I haven&rsquo;t purchased any new issues in about four months due to the overwhelming amount of advertisements. No-longer can you &ldquo;flip&rdquo; through these magazines without getting stuck on paper company ads or booklets on Adobe. The great importance of advertising is understood, however, I just find the current state of ads intrusive to my magazine reading experience. Also noticed is increased diluted content and for
these reasons I have ceased my consumption of <a href=http://www.howdesign.com>HOW</a>, <a href=http://www.commarts.com>Communication Arts</a>, <a href=http://www.printmag.com/>Print</a>
and <a href=http://www.stepinsidedesign.com>Step</a>.</p>
<p>Until they redeem themselves I&rsquo;m filling my &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; void with <a href=http://www.res.com/>Res</a>, <a href=http://www.thewire.co.uk/>Wire</a>, <a href=http://tokion.com/>Tokion</a>, <a href=http://www.wadmag.com/>Wad</a>, <a href=http://www.idnworld.com/>Idn</a>, <a href=http://www.colorsmagazine.com/>Colors</a> and <a href=http://www.metropolismag.com/>Metropolis</a>. These selections aren&rsquo;t solely devoted to design but I&rsquo;ve found reading about film, music, culture, fashion, art, and architecture to be much more inspiring.</p>
