<p>This weekend I saw <a href=http://www.yolatengo.com>Yo La Tengo</a> for the first time in Kansas City. Definitely worth the bones if they&rsquo;re in your area. Amazing jams and a really hot drummer girl. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them I recommend first getting &ldquo;I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Summer Sun.&rdquo; If your hooked you&rsquo;ll also like &ldquo;And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also did a little apartment hunting before I begin playing/working with the <a href=http://www.alwayscurious.com>fine</a> <a href=http://www.squidfingers.com>lads</a> at <a href=http://www.lookandfeel.com>Look and Feel</a>. I&rsquo;m very excited and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have many adventures to post in the coming months ;)</p>
