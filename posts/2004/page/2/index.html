<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/wireless-lack/>Wireless Lack</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, July 4, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Today my coffee house was closed for the holiday. If you could only see the look on my face. It seems to be the only downside to holidays. This didn&rsquo;t detour me from finding a hotspot that provided legally addictive &ldquo;stimulants.&rdquo;
After much driving my choices were narrowed down to Starbucks and Panera. Starbucks uses T-mobile for wifi which costs money so I chose Panera with its free wifi provided by QGO.</p>

<h3>Saturday, July 3, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Has anyone else really listened to the lyrics on the new Modest Mouse album? For lack of better words, they&rsquo;re amazing.
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights. Adding their breeze to the summer nights. Outside water like air was great. I didn&rsquo;t know what I had that day. Walk a little farther to another plan. You said that you did, but you didn&rsquo;t understand. â€” The World At Large</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/kottke-critique/>Kottke Critique</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, June 29, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Jason Kottke recently released the next incarnation of Kottke.org. I must say, even though visually things are very similar to the previous version, Jason has done an excellent job of perfecting his structure and usability.
Jason&rsquo;s text dominant design reminds us of the power of typography. His subtle choices of font sizes, weights, leading and link color are methodically chosen along with simple dividers to create a harmonious feel. From the looks of things the famous green header has been on the Atkins diet.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/fragile-sunday/>Fragile Sunday</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, June 27, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s are supposed to invite rest and relaxation, however, this was like no other Sunday I anticipated. Saturday evening was great. I stumbled upon a public showing of Waking Life in an old art studio downtown. We enjoyed tea and sat on a variety of vintage chairs watching one of my favorite films. Afterwards I was feeling very reflective and philosophical so I read some and went to bed early.</p>

<h3>Saturday, June 26, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Why do we still have mice? Seriously, haven&rsquo;t we reached the point in computer evolution where we can discard the mouse completely? Modern operating systems have the ability to solely rely on voice commands, pen devices and touch screens. Why is it taking us so long to rid ourselves of a device that is responsible for such a painful syndrome.
Mice are a thing of the past, much like CRT monitors, parallel ports, walkmans and even the compact disc.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/textpattern-flow/>Textpattern Flow</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, June 23, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to pose a question to my readers that use Textpattern. Last week I noticed Jon Hicks switched over which sparked my interest. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to switch over to a PHP based system for a while and from what I&rsquo;ve seen Textpattern is very nice. One of my issues is how to structure my content using the Section, Category, Page, etc. method that Textpattern uses. Can anyone out there provide an example or input on how they achieved a solid architecture?</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/rise-of-the-documentary/>Rise of the Documentary</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, June 6, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a connoisseur of documentary film and rarely do I read fiction opposed to non-fiction. Learning about the actions and habits of society, whether opinionated or not, has always intrigued me. It appears documentary film is rising in popularity. Not surprising due to the rise of Reality TV, they fit right in. Documentaries have allowed those with a story and small voice to speak aloud. Unfortunately, unless you live in a big city you may never get a chance to listen.</p>

<h3>Sunday, June 6, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a bone to pick with design magazines. I used to buy them frequently based on issue topics. I never subscribe, mainly because I don&rsquo;t want to confine myself to one magazine; sounds weird, deal with it. I haven&rsquo;t purchased any new issues in about four months due to the overwhelming amount of advertisements. No-longer can you &ldquo;flip&rdquo; through these magazines without getting stuck on paper company ads or booklets on Adobe.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/stopdesign-critique/>Stopdesign Critique</a></h2>
<h3>Sunday, June 6, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I felt like revisiting Douglas Bowman&rsquo;s Stopdesign since my previous critique was premature. Douglas did a fine job on many fronts. The architecture is a three column joy. Strategic attention was given to the front page where a great deal of content is displayed without overloading your eye. The subtle use of color to distinguish a hierarchy makes this possible. As you dig deeper content expands to a two column layout.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2004/gmail-big-brother/>Gmail Big Brother</a></h2>
<h3>Tuesday, June 1, 2004</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering what angle Google planned to take with its new Gmail service, currently in beta form. After some reading it all makes perfect sense. Google will offer 1GB of email space in return for the ability to scan your messages and place ads based on the content. After the excitement of 1GB wears, I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if the trade off is morally right?
Example: I receive an email regarding a relatives grave health problems; to the right ads are displayed regarding funeral homes.</p>
