<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/stopdesign-and-mezzoblue-critique/>Stopdesign and Mezzoblue Critique</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, May 26, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I hope the following designers don&rsquo;t mind my friendly critique (they shouldn&rsquo;t, design is meant to be critiqued).
Douglas Bowman of Stopdesign recently &ldquo;ditched&rdquo; his styles and &ldquo;start[ed] over with a blank slate.&rdquo; I immediately noticed the identity. Very well done. The new mark is reminiscent of the previous, however, this one is fresher and more bold. The type treatment on the logo is quite interesting as well. Playful but doesn&rsquo;t set itself apart from the mark.</p>

<h4>Monday, May 17, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>This weekend was very rejuvenating. The weather was beautiful and the town was minus over 5,000 college students. Campus was a ghost town, perfect for a little amateur skateboarding. Downtown was pretty desolate as well. Sunny weather invited me to do some outdoor sketching at the square. I drove by my future apartment enough to give my soon-to-be neighbors the impression of a stalker. Added a new Black Tea to my collection called Lapsang Souchong, it smells like campfire.</p>

<h4>Thursday, May 13, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading Studies In Design by Christopher Dresser. The book was initially published in 1875 as an inspirational guide for designers. Dresser was most notable for his contributions to the Victorian era with his intricately designed textiles, furniture and ceramics. The following are passages I felt like sharing.
Decorations, to be satisfying to the educated, must manifest knowledge&mldr; for unless the decoration is done wisely as well as with understanding , it may yet fail to please those who are best able to appreciate good ornament.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/lukova-exhibition/>Lukova Exhibition</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, May 10, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently Luba Lukova graced our local Art and Design Gallery with some of her current works and sketches. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of her style and philosophy. She currently teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
Her unique style focuses on metaphorical references, manipulation of the human form and she uses a very unique treatment of typography. I was able to snap some photos to share with you.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/quicksilver-revolution/>Quicksilver Revolution</a></h3>
<h4>Saturday, May 8, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>As soon as I realized something was flirting with perfection I discover it gets even better. Over the past three years I&rsquo;ve experienced Mac OS X evolve into, in my opinion, the most effective operating system on the planet. This revolution has spawned many enhancing third party applications. After reading the hype about Quicksilver I finally gave it some attention. Seconds after installing my jaw dropped.
I take my laptop everywhere and its my sole computer.</p>

<h4>Thursday, May 6, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been brushing up on my skills as a skateboarder behind a local Italian Restaurant. It began in my friends basement when we found a beat up skateboard during a regular weekend gathering. This sparked our interest further so we ended up buying some generic boards from a local skate shop. They were black underneath and screaming for artwork.
Last weekend we bought some spray paint (hot pink is unbelievably hard to find) and mylar.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/a-modern-experience/>A Modern Experience</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, May 3, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>The Guggenheim in Manhattan recently had an Exhibition entitled &ldquo;Singular Forms (Sometimes Repeated)&rdquo; Art from 1951 to the Present. Not your typical exhibition where you study lavish master works. The topic was Minimalism and, at first, I was somewhat timid; this being my virgin modernist exhibition. I began reading the blocks of text describing each piece while the people next too me stared hopelessly into blank canvases. I was fascinated.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/first-things-first/>First Things First</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, March 19, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been pondering many questions regarding my place as a designer. I feel I may have lost sight of certain goals which have lead me to question my purpose. Design will always be my first love, however, I need to be true to that which I love.
I spent time last night rereading The First Things First Manifesto. I recommend FTF to all designers, for it will stir up the same questions floating around in my head.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2004/kinetic-art/>Kinetic Art</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, March 14, 2004</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Over the weekend I&rsquo;ve been preparing for my trip to Manhattan that is taking place next week. I&rsquo;ve been reading up on some new artists and refreshing myself on Art History because it makes the gallery and museum experience much more enjoyable when you have some knowledge behind what your looking at.
I came across one of my favorite artists that always seems to capture my attention. Alexander Calder&rsquo;s mobiles are so fascinating to me and I always seem to stumble upon them in museums.</p>
