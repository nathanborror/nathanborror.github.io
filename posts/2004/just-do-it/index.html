<p>One of my most influential <a href=http://art.smsu.edu/peophtm/kosto.htm>professors</a> from college would always say, &ldquo;Just do it!&rdquo; in his thick Bosnian accent during sketch critiques. I&rsquo;m not sure whether he was saying it before <a href=http://www.nikelab.com>Nike</a> but recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to &ldquo;just do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all have these lists of things we want to do in life. Things we want to <a href=http://www.risd.edu>accomplish</a>, <a href=http://www.actionscript.org>practice</a>, <a href=http://www.propellerhead.se/>learn</a>, <a href=http://www.bugeurope.com/>experience</a>. We recall the list in our day dreams but loose sight of how easy it is to &ldquo;just do it.&rdquo; Then we come up with excuses and reasons why it&rsquo;s impossible to &ldquo;just do it&rdquo; or decide it&rsquo;s not the right time to &ldquo;just do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to abolish some of my brick walls that prevent me to &ldquo;just do it.&rdquo; I started this weekend by purchasing a keyboard. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to experiment with playing and creating music. Once I get a MIDI converter for my laptop and pending I start to sound good :) I&rsquo;ll post some of my creations in the Lab.</p>
<p>Good luck with your wall demolition.</p>
