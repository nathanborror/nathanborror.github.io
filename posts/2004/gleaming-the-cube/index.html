<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been brushing up on my skills as a skateboarder behind a local Italian Restaurant. It began in my friends basement when we found a beat up skateboard during a regular weekend gathering. This sparked our interest further so we ended up buying some generic boards from a local skate shop. They were black underneath and screaming for artwork.</p>
<p>Last weekend we bought some spray paint (hot pink is unbelievably hard to find) and mylar. I used the mylar to cut out a stencil that I had printed off and then we tapped that onto the bottom of the board and sprayed a few coats and presto.</p>
<p>Anyone know of a good health insurance plan?</p>
