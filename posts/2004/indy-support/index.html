<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been distancing myself from &ldquo;corporate america.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to completely do unless your <a href=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/kaczynski/1.html>Ted Kaczynski</a> but even he had to buy stamps. (Now I&rsquo;m going to get weird Google referrals on Ted Kaczynski). Anyway, I have good reason for choosing this direction.</p>
<p>My family has a history of entrepreneurs that range from a Grandfather that sold &ldquo;Nimrods&rdquo; to a mom that makes and sells women&rsquo;s clothing. This compels me to spend an extra dollar here and there in support of other entrepreneurs. I highly respect what they do and hope to be one myself someday.</p>
<p>I value the atmosphere and uniqueness of indy shops. More and more &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; businesses are turning to <a href=http://www.apple.com/retail/>cookie cutter</a> designs for their establishments. This is somewhat disheartening, however, I understand why they do it. Consistency helps them but also dulls them. Yesterday I walked into a local cafe to grab coffee before work; some great jazz was playing in the background that set the mood for the rest of my day. Today I bought a <a href=http://www.noisefactoryrecords.com/bss.htm>CD</a> at a local record store and got some info on new bands from the owner. I also visited a new clothing boutique with some really unique clothing that you wouldn&rsquo;t find anywhere else in this city. During all these experiences I&rsquo;m greeted by familiar, helpful people.</p>
<p>Independent businesses not only provides quality products, great people and unique atmospheres; they also have the ability enrich our lives.</p>
