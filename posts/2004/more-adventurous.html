# More Adventurous

About a year ago a friend of mine introduced me to a little world called [Rilo Kiley](http://www.rilokiley.com). Her two albums, _Execution of All Things_ and _Takeoffs and Landings,_ bring sunshine to a rainy day and lift you up to a place not often visited through music. Jenny Lewis's voice never seems to grow old. They're songs are so diverse and colorful.

I honestly didn't believe they could top their last two releases. _More Adventurous_ proves me wrong and lives up to its name. The only way to describe it is if you took a petal from each of your favorite flowers and pasted them all together creating a colleague of fragrance. You can hear a little bit of the past, present and get a gimps of the future. This band has a lot of potential and definitely worth experiencing.
