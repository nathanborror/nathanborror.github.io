# Lack of Words

If you've noticed I've been pretty lame with my entries lately. Mainly due to [work](http://www.neubix.com/), [work](http://www.smsu.edu/) and freelance work. Good things are around the corner so bare with me. In the mean time I've come across some good reads:

- [If it ain't broke, don't fix it?](http://www.kottke.org/04/02/innovation)
- [Drop Shadow League](http://zeldman.com/daily/0204h.shtml)
- [Understanding Design](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/02/23/understandin/)
