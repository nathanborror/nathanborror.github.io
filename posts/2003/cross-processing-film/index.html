What is cross processing you ask? Well basically you use the opposite chemicals to develop the film. Normally negative film is processed with C-41 chemicals and slide film is processed with E6.">

<p>Today I got my first roll of cross-processed negative film produced by my new <a href=http://www.lomography.com>Lomo</a>. I&rsquo;m pretty impressed. It took me a while to find a place in town that would cross process negative film but a little mom and pop shop pulled through for me.</p>
<p>What is cross processing you ask? Well basically you use the opposite chemicals to develop the film. Normally negative film is processed with C-41 chemicals and slide film is processed with E6. If you use the opposite chemicals you get a very vintage effect. With the negative film, things become very blue and hazy. My next roll will be slide and from what I&rsquo;ve read slide film, when cross processed, creates more bold rich colors.</p>
<p>One of the secrets to cross processing is over-exposing the film by one stop. This can be easily done by changing the ASA. Example: If your using 200 ASA tell your camera you&rsquo;re using 100 ASA and this will allow for a touch of over exposure. You might even try experimenting with two stops.</p>
