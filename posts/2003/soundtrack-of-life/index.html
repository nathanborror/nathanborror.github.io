<p>You may find this odd but have you ever consciously listened to a particular CD during a particular time of your life in hopes that the music will in some way encapsulate those memories?</p>
<p>When I was in New York last March I listened to The Postal Service over and over and now every time I listen to that CD I remember walking up and down broadway and roaming around the subways. Last month I listened to Death Cab for Cutie while <a href=http://www.neubix.com>we</a> were in Los Angeles and now the same thing happens. It&rsquo;s sort of the soundtrack of life.</p>
<p>Or perhaps I just have a fetish with Ben Gibbard?</p>
