Last month I listened to Death Cab for Cutie while \u003ca href=\"http://www.neubix.com\"\u003ewe\u003c/a\u003e were in Los Angeles and now the same thing happens. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of the soundtrack of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps I just have a fetish with Ben Gibbard?\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"Cross-Processing Film","date_published":"2003-11-03T18:58:00-0800","date_modified":"2003-11-03T18:58:00-0800","id":"https://nathan.run/posts/2003/cross-processing-film/","url":"https://nathan.run/posts/2003/cross-processing-film/","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eToday I got my first roll of cross-processed negative film produced by my new \u003ca href=\"http://www.lomography.com\"\u003eLomo\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty impressed. It took me a while to find a place in town that would cross process negative film but a little mom and pop shop pulled through for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is cross processing you ask? Well basically you use the opposite chemicals to develop the film. Normally negative film is processed with C-41 chemicals and slide film is processed with E6. If you use the opposite chemicals you get a very vintage effect. With the negative film, things become very blue and hazy. My next roll will be slide and from what I\u0026rsquo;ve read slide film, when cross processed, creates more bold rich colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the secrets to cross processing is over-exposing the film by one stop. This can be easily done by changing the ASA. Example: If your using 200 ASA tell your camera you\u0026rsquo;re using 100 ASA and this will allow for a touch of over exposure. You might even try experimenting with two stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]}
