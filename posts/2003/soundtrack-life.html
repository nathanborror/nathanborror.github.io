# Soundtrack of Life

You may find this odd but have you ever consciously listened to a particular CD during a particular time of your life in hopes that the music will in some way encapsulate those memories?

When I was in New York last March I listened to The Postal Service over and over and now every time I listen to that CD I remember walking up and down broadway and roaming around the subways. Last month I listened to Death Cab for Cutie while [we][1] were in Los Angeles and now the same thing happens. It's sort of the soundtrack of life.

Or perhaps I just have a fetish with Ben Gibbard?
