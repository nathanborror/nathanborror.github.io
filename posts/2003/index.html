<p>You may find this odd but have you ever consciously listened to a particular CD during a particular time of your life in hopes that the music will in some way encapsulate those memories?
When I was in New York last March I listened to The Postal Service over and over and now every time I listen to that CD I remember walking up and down broadway and roaming around the subways.</p>

<p>Today I got my first roll of cross-processed negative film produced by my new Lomo. I&rsquo;m pretty impressed. It took me a while to find a place in town that would cross process negative film but a little mom and pop shop pulled through for me.
What is cross processing you ask? Well basically you use the opposite chemicals to develop the film. Normally negative film is processed with C-41 chemicals and slide film is processed with E6.</p>
