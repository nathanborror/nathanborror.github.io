  # LJWorld redesign

  So for the past five months or so we've been working on a redesign for the [Lawrence Journal-World](http://ljworld.com). For those of you that don't know, it's a daily newspaper that circulates the town of Lawrence, Kansas. It's quite small compared to surrounding markets which makes it very agile and free from shareholders and their evil agendas.

  I had a feeling this project would be special and challenging but I had no idea of the scale. Turns out, around the same time I was tasked with designing [Marketplace](http://ljworld.com/marketplace), a directory of 4000+ local businesses. I must also mention, news doesn't stop for redesigns. It's definitely a juggling act when your trying to complete a site thats constantly having to push out news features and various timely events like [local elections](http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2007/apr/03/races/lawrence_city_commission/). There were, shall I say, growing pains.
  Details aside, the design is [simple](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/politics/kansas_legislature/). In fact the design is designed to disappear. Content is what really matters so I decided to take an approach that would make the overall design feel supportive rather than overbearing. This isn't easy for anyone and requires extreme discipline. Discipline I never thought I had.

  The site will continue to take shape over time. We're hoping that redesigns are a thing of the past and constant iterations are a thing of the future. We'll see how long that lasts ;-)
  This project wouldn't have been possible without the involvement of [James Bennett](http://www.b-list.org/), Dan Cox, [Jeff Croft](http://www.jeffcroft.com/), [Matt Croydon](http://postneo.com/), [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](http://www.jacobian.org/), Joel Mathis, [Christian Metts](http://www.mintchaos.com/), David Ryan, Tom Tobin, all the web producers and all the editors and reporters that allow us to do what we do.
