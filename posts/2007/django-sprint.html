  # Django Sprint

  Armed with high levels of legally addictive stimulants, silver laptops, and brilliant minds, Django will get even closer to 1.0 [today](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2007/nov/07/sprint/). If you have any interest in being apart of today's event, scurry over to the Django site and scan for tickets that catch your eye and expertise. Join us in IRC (irc.freenode.net) in the #django-sprint room or if you're lucky enough to live near Lawrence, Kansas come join us!
