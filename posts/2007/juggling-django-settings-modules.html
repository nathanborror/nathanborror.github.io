  # Juggling Django settings modules

  If you find yourself juggling multiple Django projects and constantly changing the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable, try this simple shortcut.

  Upon diving into a particular project I define an alias in my .bash_profile that gets me to the project directory in as few keystrokes as possible. For example, to get to my playgroundblues directory I simply type 'pb' and I'm in the root of playgroundblues.com. Here is the line of code in my .bash_profile:

  ```sh
  alias pb="cd /Working/www/playgroundblues.com/"
  ```

  Pretty straight forward, however, since I'm going to that project I might as well set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE at the same time so I've altered the line above to:

  ```sh
  alias pb="cd /Working/www/playgroundblues.com/; export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=playgroundblues.settings"
  ```

  Now I'm in the proper directory with the proper settings file is in focus. Bliss.
