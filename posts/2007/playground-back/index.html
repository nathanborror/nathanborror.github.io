<p>With every rendition of my person site I must emphasize that this is a work in
progress. With that said, welcome to my new playground. Sorry about the neurotic
name changes. I can assure you they are over and I&rsquo;m pretty darn happy with the
new digs.</p>
<h2 id=why-redesign>Why redesign?</h2>
<p>I wanted to return to my roots. I started out as Playground Blues and this is
where I belong. I also wanted something with room to grow. Something that had
lots of drawers and cubby holes for me to put random bits. As much as I love
structure and organization, taxonomies and folksonomies; I wanted to be able to
throw things out there, like little easter eggs. This design lets me do just
that.</p>
<h2 id=to-be-expected>To be expected.</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect anything from me. It&rsquo;s better that way. I can only surprise you from
here on out. My hopes are that you&rsquo;ll begin to see more of those ?&rsquo;s disappear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about this new direction. I hope too see some of you in
Austin at this years South by Southwest!</p>
<p>Update: Here&rsquo;s the Photoshop (<a href=http://playgroundblues.com/media/source/playground-blues.zip>http://playgroundblues.com/media/source/playground-blues.zip</a>)
for this design. Feel free to remix and play.</p>
