<p>I&rsquo;ve heard wisperings about the death of blogs lately. More and more we see our
favorite writters fading into the ether. This begs the question, what next? What
do we do with the barren ghost towns that once thrived on eager readers making
sure their cache was cleared before stalking their favorites.</p>
<p>Personal sites should be cornucopias which chronicle our lives. They should be
open sketchbooks crammed with a maze of twists and turns. We should be able to
post without shame or regret things that later on demonstrate our progress. I
want to browse sites like Chris Glass (<a href=http://www.chrisglass.com/>http://www.chrisglass.com/</a>) which feels
like a time capsule where I can rummage around and get a sense of someone&rsquo;s life.
It&rsquo;s incredibly motivating to see his travel logs, journal entries, photos and
favorites. All neatly packaged with thought and purpose. You can tell this site
not only serves his audience, but seems to play an important role for him.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious that 2007 is a turning point for blogging but it&rsquo;s also a
chance to question what we should strive for in a personal site. Social
networking seems to have decentralized our lives and allowed us to stray farther
away from our personal sites, but thanks to API&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re beginning to gain back
some centralization. We really shouldn&rsquo;t shackle ourselves to the output of an
API, nor should we restrict ourselves to &ldquo;dynamic content&rdquo; that comes from a CMS.
Most of us are highly skilled in HTML/CSS and we shouldn&rsquo;t fear one off pages
and designs. I remember the days of updating my blog via HTML, when I had
something to show I didn&rsquo;t ask how it was going to live in a CMS, I just threw
it up.</p>
<p>With this in mind I don&rsquo;t exactly know where Playground Blues is headed. There
is a lot of data that I&rsquo;m collecting that I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to share or
even if it makes sense to share. I am, however, eager to explore the Art of
maintaining a personal site and in the coming weeks I&rsquo;d like to discuss this
more along with some of my concerns regarding digital preservation. Stay tuned.</p>
