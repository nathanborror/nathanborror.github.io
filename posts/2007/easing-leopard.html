  # Easing into Leopard

  I'm a UI geek and the first thing I noticed during the iPhone demo was how fun scrolling seems. With small devices and even regular sized computers a majority of our time is spent scrolling various collections of content. Only a company like Apple can step back, recognize this, and make it fun. This will no doubt engage users, bringing them closer to [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

  Easing has been around a long time. I remember learning how to do it in Flash with the aid of [Joshua Davis](http://www.joshuadavis.com/). You could fling that scroll bar right across the screen and have to bounce right back. Then [Robert Penner](http://www.robertpenner.com/) made everyones life easier with his ubiquitous easing equations.

  I can't help but imagine this new iPhone UI hinted at a lot of what we'll be seeing in Leopard. I don't know if everyone would want easing in Leopard but, if done right, it could bring to life a hella fun interface. It might also help some of us that design huge content sites :)
