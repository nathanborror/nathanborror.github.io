<h4>Tuesday, December 4, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Adobe just released Update 3 of Flash Player 9. This is HUGE. Streaming video is no longer a laughing matter. Streaming High Definition video will become common place and it starts today.
Everyone talks about BlueRay and HD-DVD, but what they don&rsquo;t realize is they&rsquo;ve already been obsolesced before catching stride. VHS is dead, brick and mortar video rental is on life support, and DVD just checked in with chest pains.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/django-basic-apps/>Django Basic Apps</a></h3>
<h4>Sunday, December 2, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on abstracting some Django applications from past projects so they can effortlessly be plugged into future projects. I hate writing the same blog application repeatedly, so this is an attempt to make life easier. I think this will be a fun, little suite of plug-n-play Django apps that everyone can benefit from.
I&rsquo;m calling this suite Basic Apps with the hopes they&rsquo;ll live up to their name. They&rsquo;re freely distributed under the New BSD License and hosted at Google Code.</p>

<p>Armed with high levels of legally addictive stimulants, silver laptops, and brilliant minds, Django will get even closer to 1.0 today. If you have any interest in being apart of today&rsquo;s event, scurry over to the Django site and scan for tickets that catch your eye and expertise. Join us in IRC (irc.freenode.net) in the #django-sprint room or if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to live near Lawrence, Kansas come join us!</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/juggling-django-settings-modules/>Juggling Django settings modules</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, November 6, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>If you find yourself juggling multiple Django projects and constantly changing the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable, try this simple shortcut.
Upon diving into a particular project I define an alias in my .bash_profile that gets me to the project directory in as few keystrokes as possible. For example, to get to my playgroundblues directory I simply type &lsquo;pb&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m in the root of playgroundblues.com. Here is the line of code in my .</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/care-to-scrum/>Care to scrum?</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, October 17, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>We need more scrums and less meetings. A scrum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) is a 5-10 minute stand-up meeting. About 80% of the meetings I&rsquo;ve ever attended have included at least five people. Any meeting over three becomes a presentation while one bloviates and others wander.
It&rsquo;s been a while since my last scrum. It included seven people, complete participation, no dominance, one referee, and was contained within a 10 minute package. Rather than walking away in a typical post-meeting cloud of confusion, I left the scrum feeling clear and informed.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/trials-of-the-i-70-commute/>Trials of the I-70 commute</a></h3>
<h4>Monday, October 15, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>A while ago I began working back in the big city while remaining in modest Lawrence. This required a 40 min. x 2 drive into the sun five days a week. It wasn&rsquo;t so bad at first, but the race through traffic and mass of incandescent gas started taking its toll.
I decided to evaluate what was wearing me out. The sun, for one, was melting my retinas and giving me headaches.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/subliminal-culture/>Subliminal Culture</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, September 21, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading more of Lev Manovich&rsquo;s (http://www.manovich.com) Language of New Media. Manovich discusses the methods in which we access new media. He mentions some research done by Paul Virilio on the collapsing effect technology has on the distances between people and content. Before, if a person wanted to see the works of Da Vinci they&rsquo;d have to travel to a book store or an art museum. With the advent of new media it&rsquo;s as simple as pulling up a browser.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/manually-compressing-pngs/>Manually Compressing PNGs</a></h3>
<h4>Tuesday, September 18, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>With the advent of some very clean hacks to make PNGs work in IE I&rsquo;ve found myself working them into my designs more. Using them has allowed me to achieve some effects that were next to impossible with JPEGs and GIFs. The biggest hurdle in using PNGs is their file size. The export tools in Photoshop tie your hands behind your back, not allowing you to tweak anything that may lead to a more compact file.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/iphone-dead-30-rental/>iPhone dead; $30 rental?</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, August 15, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>This morning I woke up on my own. Normally I hear little crickets chirping around 7am which is my iPhone letting me know it&rsquo;s time to face the coming day. This morning, no crickets. At first I thought maybe the battery was flat, but that&rsquo;s not possible. I charged it the day before and didn&rsquo;t put it through any rigorous usage. So iPhone CPR commences.
First I try a hard restart, holding down the home and on/off button for a few seconds.</p>

<h3><a href=https://nathan.run/2007/blueprints-are-not-final/>Blueprints are not final</a></h3>
<h4>Friday, August 10, 2007</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>So apparently a little framework called Blueprint (http://bjorkoy.com/blueprint) has reared it&rsquo;s head, born from a few stylesheets that look very familiar. I&rsquo;m somewhat conflicted with its release because I don&rsquo;t think it should be used. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s great, but don&rsquo;t use it.
About five or so months ago I was working on the Journal-World (http://www.ljworld.com) redesign. News sites tend to be very column heavy and I was getting tired of writing the same code over and over to accommodate for my design iterations.</p>
