From what I gather there are three\nflavors: a simple \u0026ldquo;one vote\u0026rdquo; method, a thumbs up or down, and the scale. Each\nsolutions goal is to find out what people think of your content. This is helpful\nwhen trying to understand your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"the-one-vote-method\"\u003eThe \u0026ldquo;one vote\u0026rdquo; method\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs simple as it gets. If someone likes a piece of content they simply click a\nbutton saying so. Nothing more nothing less. This is a visceral response, a\n\u0026ldquo;blink\u0026rdquo; reaction which requires minimal thought. The downside is you can\u0026rsquo;t infer\nthat a non-vote means people dislike content. A non-vote most likely means they\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t read the content enough to care which could suggest weak content but it\u0026rsquo;s\na little grey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"thumbs-up-thumbs-down\"\u003eThumbs up, thumbs down\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one makes me think of Siskel and Ebert and their black and white critiques\nof film.  Probably the most widely used style because of its simplicity. Like\nthe \u0026ldquo;one vote\u0026rdquo; method, it relies on gut reactions but allows people to express\ntheir dislike for a piece of content. The style sometimes borrows the\nvisualization side of the scale system below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"scale\"\u003eScale\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrequently represented as stars, we commonly see this method used along with\nreviews and entertainment ratings. This system requires the most amount of\nthought from a person which often leads to poor return. It\u0026rsquo;s best used in\nsituations where a person is investing time into writing a review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImplementing a rating system isn\u0026rsquo;t for the faint of heart. You need to be\ncomfortable with powers of online democracy. Oddly enough rating systems are\nwhy Google works. They\u0026rsquo;re Page Rank system is based almost entirely on the\n\u0026ldquo;one vote\u0026rdquo; method where a link from one site to another stands as a \u0026ldquo;vote.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Democracy on the web works.\u0026quot;](\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html\u003c/a\u003e)\nThis can be seen on Newsvine, Digg, Delicious, Flickr, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"Playground is back","date_published":"2007-02-28T00:00:00-0800","date_modified":"2007-02-28T00:00:00-0800","id":"https://nathan.run/2007/playground-is-back/","url":"https://nathan.run/2007/playground-is-back/","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eWith every rendition of my person site I must emphasize that this is a work in\nprogress.
