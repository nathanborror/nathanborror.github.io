slightly curb this I&rsquo;ve manifested the list below. Warning: I cannot guarantee
I&rsquo;ve finished these books. I have a tendency, possibly fear, of finishing books.
I literally get to the last chapter and it sits on my coffee table for weeks.
So far, these have been intriguing books to me:</p><p><strong>Blink and The Tipping Point</strong> by Malcom Gladwell. I group these two together
because they go hand in hand. Blink is about snap judgement. It takes a very
micro approach on how we make decisions in the blink of an eye. Tipping Point
slaps on a macro lens and dives into how we as a society come to fall in love
with products. Both are fascinating and suited well for anyone interested in the
human psyche.</p><p><strong>A Whole New Mind</strong> by Daniel Pink. The Information Age is nearing it&rsquo;s slow
death and we&rsquo;re beginning to witness the rise of the Conceptual Age. Think twice
about getting that MBA. With the outsourcing of &ldquo;information jobs&rdquo; to Asia you
may want to investigate the fruits of the MFA. This book is a portal to many
resources and it&rsquo;s been keeping me very busy.</p><p><strong>Voices of a People&rsquo;s History of the United States</strong> by Howard Zinn. How did I
end up believing Christopher Columbus was a &ldquo;great man&rdquo; and worthy of his own
day. This was a man that &ldquo;kidnapped, maimed and killed the indigenous people of
Hispanola in pursuit of gold.&rdquo; This book sheds much needed light on those who in
the face of opposition and hardship spoke out. This undeniable view of history
is shocking and raw.</p><p>Graphic Designers Guide to Clients by Ellen Shapiro. I used to be very defensive
around clients. Mainly because I lacked the ability to put myself in their
shoes. Shapiro provides numerous real world examples of successful client
relationships.</p><p>Story, Substance, Structure, Style, and The Principles of Screenwriting by
Robert McKee. Why should a web designer care about story? It happens to be the
vehicle to our minds. A good story can elicit any number of emotions. Emotions
are products of the right side of our brain which is the gateway to the left.
In advertising or design we must be in tune with this so our message effectively
captivates its audience. McKee intricately dissects the building blocks of good
story.</p><p>Hopefully this will wet your appetite. Any number of these will make you think
differently after setting them down. I&rsquo;ve been permanently altered by all of
them.</p>

for your Rails app. It can be found on the Rails Wiki under<a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/TextSearch">TextSearch</a>. I recommend clicking on
the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; button at the bottom to copy and paste the code out of the text field
because some of the syntax gets lost on the page version. Just don&rsquo;t click save :)</p><p>You may want to add &lsquo;%" on either side of the search terms. This will increase
results by returning words like &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; when the term &ldquo;design&rdquo; has been
searched. There is also some code on the page to help search multiple keywords
instead of phrases. This could be altered to act like Google where if you want
to search by a phrase you encapsulate the phrase with quotes. You would then
just do a check for quotes before breaking the words into an array.</p>

It allows
you to jump out of your inner chaotic life and realize that you&rsquo;re not alone.
Now, there are a few keys to successful people watching. I&rsquo;ll share some of
mine, then you can pass yours along if you wish.</p><ul><li><em>Avoid eye contact.</em> In order to remain a fly on the wall you must avoid eye
contact at all costs. After a while you begin to anticipate when someone will
look at you. This is a honed skill that comes with time and patients. A good
pair of sunglasses can help beginners.</li><li><em>Daydreaming is a side effect, and its Okay.</em> This allows you to &ldquo;figure stuff
out.&rdquo; In my opinion we don&rsquo;t daydream enough. We get so caught up in<em>doing</em>
and we forget<em>why.</em> Those are perfect moments to gain understanding with
the help of those around you.</li><li><em>Location is key.</em> I like coffee hang outs. Villages, Malls, Districts, or any
high traffic parts of your metropolis where eclecticism is prevalent. I prefer
a corner in midtown where coffee houses collide, a lonely clothing store
awaits hipsters, and bars are armed with dollar draws and outdoor patios. The
collage of people has the characteristics of a Rauschenberg
(<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=rauschenberg">http://images.google.com/images?q=rauschenberg</a>) exhibit.</li></ul><p>Now its your turn. How, where, and why do you people watch? What strange stories
have you made up or overheard during your excursions? Do tell :)</p>

Approximately<a href="http://playgroundblues.com/archive/bejeweled">two weeks</a> ago I

welcoming and easy to learn. I only wish it were just as easy to ween clients

being my move from Textile to<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>

The whole idea of
the &ldquo;pre-order&rdquo; is that your John Hancock gets placed on a list of elite few who
get first dibs on a product before it sells out. It is virtually impossible for
iTunes to sell out of a song, which makes me wonder what yahoo in the war room
decided it&rsquo;d be cool to have &ldquo;pre-orders&rdquo; in iTunes. Downloadable music is
branded as instant satisfaction which makes this confusing.</p><p>I understand it sort of serves as a teaser but this is the web and thats just a
lame use of it. Offer me an exclusive song and tell me it&rsquo;ll be followed up by
an album (which they already do and seems to work). I pray for the server
administrators that sweat their bandwidth skyrocket when the clock strikes
twelve and um-teen-thousand albums are automatically dispersed. (End of rant)</p>

codec I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if we&rsquo;re glimpsing a bigger picture here. If you
haven&rsquo;t checked out the unbelievable quality of H.264 go over to the<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/">HD Gallery</a> and witness the days of pixilation
disappear.</p><p>With this brings some interesting thoughts; does Apple have a roadmap for video
on demand? Well, they&rsquo;ve already started doing it with iTunes 4.8. We now have
the choice to buy music videos and video extras that would normally be found on
CD&rsquo;s. This however doesn&rsquo;t seem to be using the H.264 codec at the moment but
I&rsquo;m sure it will follow. Will the iPod soon have video functionality to echo
iTunes?</p><blockquote><p>People love listening to music as a background activity when they&rsquo;re
exercising, when they&rsquo;re commuting and when they&rsquo;re just hanging out. Music is
a wonderful thing because A, it&rsquo;s music, and B, because it can be listened to
as a background activity. And a lot of these other things that people are
talking about building in, such as video and things like that, are foreground
activities.
&ndash; Steve Jobs</p></blockquote><p>It appears the iPod is slowly creeping into our foreground. Right behind it
could be a video-on-demand Mac Mini. I only hope they choose to offer not-so
mainstream content like Independent Films and Documentaries that you wouldn&rsquo;t
normally find on television. Could this also pave the way for a new bread of
video podcasts? Vidcasts?</p>

at first, things were slow and hard drive was crankin'. Once Spotlight finished

&ldquo;command-spacebar&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll never need that pesky finder dock icon. Still not sure
what to say about Safari RSS, its crashed about five times now. WebKit is
apparently much better but I have a feeling 10.4.1 will be a major bug fixer so
some may want to wait a week or two.</p><p>While there is some new eye candy, Tiger is all about saving time and becoming
more efficiant. Hopefully some of the philosophies will spill into other areas

like buying fake plants instead of real ones. off-the-shelf products leave very
little wiggle room for growth and are inevitably more than what you need. They

do is water and provide sunshine. This allows your tools to grow into the
environment they are intended rather than trying to fit a square peg into a
round hole. This also establishes a standard way of coding so when new
programers come on board all they need to do is learn the framework and they&rsquo;re
ready to roll.</p><p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> is an example of a rising framework.<a href="http://www.phppatterns.com">PHP Patterns</a> also provide an enormous listing of

introduced to this theory by<a href="http://www.squidfingers.com">Travis</a> and<a href="http://www.alwayscurious.com">Charlie</a>. Soon after, it began popping into my head at
work, home, or while I was coding. Then I started noticing it in<a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/">books</a> and on the<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4520866">radio</a>.</p><p>The theory is normally applied to urban decay and crime, however, it can be
applied to almost anything. How did your apartment get so dirty? How did your
code get out of control? Well, it&rsquo;s all because of one sock, one poorly placed
if statement, or one broken window.</p><blockquote><p>One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills
a sense of abandonment — a sense that the powers that be don&rsquo;t care. So another
window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural
damage begins. In a relativly short space of time, the structure becomes damaged
beyond the desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.</p></blockquote><p>The preceding quote was taken from<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. It
basically means watch out for the small stuff. If you can keep the tiny cracks
out early they won&rsquo;t turn into gorges. The hope is that if your projects are

While I may not be an expert in
learning science I did participate in the Education system for 17 years and
continue to work for an University.</p><p>Currently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General
Education pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and
so on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is
wrong. Students shouldn&rsquo;t be pressured into learning anything. During my
freshman year in college I despised going to my Physical Education class because
it was so boring and a waste of my time and effort. However, I now realize the
positive affects exercise can have in my life and work. This is where the
problem lies. That course should have excited me about the affects that physical
activity can bring to my desired goals in life.</p><blockquote><p>Students learn best when motivated, when they care. They need to be
emotionally involved, to be drawn to the excitement of the topic. Learning<br>
need not be a dull or dreary exercise, not even learning about what are
normally considered dull and dreary topics: every topic can be made exciting,
every topic excites the emotions of someone, so why not excite everyone?
&ndash; Donald Norman, Emotional Design</p></blockquote><p>What if we broke down the barriers of Education. Instead of offering courses we
enrolled in what I&rsquo;ll call Communities. Each Community would have a focus: Art,
Science, Mathematics; within each community Groups, with related focuses, would
form. For example the Art Community would have a Group which focuses on Design
or Pottery. The students of these communities would not organize in classrooms
nor would they participate in courses. Each Community would reside in its very
own research library. I use the term library loosely because the environment
would need to cater to a wide variety of situations: discussion, research,
building, brainstorming, and so on. Each student would draft goals for
themselves, for the Group, and for the Community. Within the Communities
professors would apply general education discussions based on the goals of the
Community. Students need to learn History so the Communities promote learning
about the Middle Ages and how it relates to the students individual goals, there
by validating its importance to the overall purpose of the Community. Students
would then begin to realize how imperative it is to understand not just one
subject, but all subjects in relation to their goals thereby creating a well
rounded diverse society.</p><blockquote><p>It is time for lessons to become alive, for history to be seen as a human
struggle, for students to understand and appreciate the structure of art,
music, science, and mathematics. How can these topics be made exciting? By
making them relevant to the lives of each individual student.
&ndash; Donald Norman, Emotional Design</p></blockquote><p>Education is the cornerstone of society. Without Education society breaks down.
As we grow and mature throughout our life we should never cease to learn. Our
Education institutions must promote life long learning rather than handing out
diplomas and saying next. While this idea may or may not succeed I feel it&rsquo;s
important to continually evolve our methods of teaching and learning in order to
evolve as a society. With that in mind I invite your thoughts and criticism.</p>

grateful to have been apart of their transformation and growth. For now I&rsquo;ll be
overseeing the production of interactive and film projects, as well as
advocating standards support and adoption of Open technologies.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also moved to a very old apartment next to a very busy street. Outside my
window rests an Art supplies store and many restaurants. I can walk to work,
grocery store, and downtown which makes me oh so happy. Pictures are on the way.</p><p>On a personal level I&rsquo;m looking forward to creating more Fine Art. The past year
hasn&rsquo;t provided much time for this, my goal is to pursue painting and mixed
media. I&rsquo;ll also be brushing up on my programming skills to satisfy the left
side of my brain.</p><p>As with every coin there is a flip side that I unfortunately can&rsquo;t reveal at
this time. Stay tuned for more articles and updates.</p>

If you could only see the look on my face. It seems to be the only downside to holidays. This didn&rsquo;t detour me from finding a hotspot that provided legally addictive &ldquo;stimulants.&rdquo;</p><p>After much driving my choices were narrowed down to Starbucks and Panera. Starbucks uses T-mobile for wifi which costs money so I chose Panera with its free wifi provided by<a href="http://www.goqgo.com/">QGO</a>.</p><p>After realizing this isn&rsquo;t the crowd I&rsquo;m used too I found a nice little spot in the corner to get down to business. I was first presented with a Panera screen in my browser asking me to agree with its Wi-Fi Terms. After reading over the four page document and knowing that all rights to privacy will be infringed upon I clicked Agree and went on my way. I must note, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve had to do this ever, anywhere. I hear its the same way at Starbucks but I&rsquo;ve grown accustom to independent shops that don&rsquo;t care what you do while respecting your privacy.</p><p>Needless to say Panera&rsquo;s wifi is very slow and, privacy aside, not worth it due to their lack of coffee making abilities. I hope more free hotspots open up. I&rsquo;ve never understood why places charge for wifi, it&rsquo;s very cheep for the store to provide and attracts customers.</p>

Outside water like air was great.
I didn&rsquo;t know what I had that day.

well who would wanna be?
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
— Bukowski</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Well that is that and this is this.
Will you tell me what you saw and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you missed,
when the ocean met the sky.
You missed when time on life shook hands and said goodbye.
When the earth folded in on itself.

are really there, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath.&rdquo;
You wasted life, why wouldn&rsquo;t you waste death?
— Ocean Breathes Salty</p></blockquote><p>Some are just ironically uplifting.</p><blockquote><p>Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with a scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight-of-hand

Well we&rsquo;ll float on good news is on the way.

We&rsquo;re not much farther that we were in the cave.
— The View</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s one thing to have an album with great beats and rhythms but it&rsquo;s another to have rich, thought provoking lyrics. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

incarnation of<a href="http://www.kottke.org">Kottke.org</a>. I must say, even though
visually things are very similar to the previous version, Jason has done an
excellent job of perfecting his structure and usability.</p><p>Jason&rsquo;s text dominant design reminds us of the power of typography. His subtle
choices of font sizes, weights, leading and link color are methodically chosen
along with simple dividers to create a harmonious feel. From the looks of things
the famous green header has been on the Atkins diet. It may have slimmed up a
bit but it&rsquo;s just enough to remind you, This Is Kottke.</p><p>Kottke tweaked the two column layout, widening the left column a bit. I&rsquo;ve
always enjoyed the way Jason nestles his daily links into his blog column. This
works exceptionally well from a usability standpoint and gives the links more
attention in the hierarchy.</p><p>From the comments form (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/06/5909.html">http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/06/5909.html</a>) to the
photo gallery (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/photos/highline0204/index.html">http://www.kottke.org/photos/highline0204/index.html</a>) and beyond
you can tell that a lot of care and thought went into every element of this
redesign. Well done Jason, take a bow.</p>

Saturday evening was great. I stumbled upon a public showing of Waking Life in an old art studio downtown. We enjoyed tea and sat on a variety of vintage chairs watching one of my favorite films. Afterwards I was feeling very reflective and philosophical so I read some and went to bed early.</p><p>Around 4:22am my ears caught the sound of rain. I lay there enjoying the drops hitting my window hoping it would only add to my already adventurous dream. Something wasn&rsquo;t quite right, the rain was very sporadic. My eyes opened to a bright orange filled room. I glanced at my clock, 4:23am. Sun doesn&rsquo;t rise this early, nor does it shine through my north window. Decided to peak through my blinds only to be presented with hellish flames swallowing the building thirty feet away from me. Fear, only to be overcome by panic. What do I grab? Where are my pants, shoes, glasses? Grab film negatives, laptop and the first camera you see. Bolting for the door I said a quick goodbye to my apartment just in case. Seven fire engines, dozens of Springfield&rsquo;s finest firefighters, and gallons of water later the fire subsided. By the graces of god all twenty one residents were safe with no injuries. My building, amazingly unscathed. The same couldn&rsquo;t be said for my neighbors.</p><p>As they salvage their charred homes with boxes from the Red Cross, hoping to find those few untouched items I can&rsquo;t help but think how fragile we are. Lives weren&rsquo;t lost but they are changed.</p><p>The cause was attributed to a single cigarette. Astonishing how such a small item of bad habit can disrupt and endanger the lives of innocent people. I&rsquo;m moving to a new apartment soon and I plan to purchase a fire extinguisher, renters insurance, learn more about gas stoves and equip every room with a smoke/carbon monoxide detector. Thank you Firefighters, Red Cross and Police. We are indebted to the extraordinary service and care you provide.</p>

Seriously, haven&rsquo;t we reached the point in computer
evolution where we can discard the mouse completely?<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Modern operating systems</a> have the ability to solely rely on voice
commands, pen devices and touch screens. Why is it taking us so long to rid
ourselves of a device that is responsible for such a<a href="http://familydoctor.org/023.xml">painful syndrome</a>.</p><p>Mice are a thing of the past, much like CRT monitors, parallel ports, walkmans
and even the compact disc. It&rsquo;s time to let go, look to the future of usability
and functionality. For regular users (i.e. email, word processing, chatting,
etc.) the absence of the mouse would be an easier transition, however, the
utilization of a pen device would have to be retained for web browsing and other
tasks that utilize buttons or links too small for fingers to press.</p><p>I believe that direct interaction with a surface that provides feedback can be a
very positive experience for the user. You become more involved in the activity
at hand rather than indirectly moving a mouse around and arbitrarily clicking. I
long for the day when my sketchbook uploads to my laptop, logging my daily ideas
where I can call them up based on day, keywords, project or mood.</p>

I used to buy them frequently based on issue topics. I never subscribe, mainly because I don&rsquo;t want to confine myself to one magazine; sounds weird, deal with it. I haven&rsquo;t purchased any new issues in about four months due to the overwhelming amount of advertisements. No-longer can you &ldquo;flip&rdquo; through these magazines without getting stuck on paper company ads or booklets on Adobe. The great importance of advertising is understood, however, I just find the current state of ads intrusive to my magazine reading experience. Also noticed is increased diluted content and for

since my previous critique was premature. Douglas did a fine job on many fronts.
The architecture is a three column joy. Strategic attention was given to the
front page where a great deal of content is displayed without overloading your
eye. The subtle use of color to distinguish a hierarchy makes this possible. As
you dig deeper content expands to a two column layout. The right bar is like a
companion at your side always informing you of relevant and/or alternate links.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of iconography. Douglas does a fine job at paying close
attention to icons that not only add detail but inform. It&rsquo;s very important to
have a method or reason behind everything and his icons express whether you&rsquo;re
about to view a document, comment, click away or click into the site.</p><p>With each section there is a drastically different look utilizing blurred images
and color, however the structure stays consistent. I&rsquo;ve heard some say this is
too drastic and it&rsquo;s hard for me to decide. I enjoy the distinct difference
between the<a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> and the<a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/">log</a>. It bluntly informs you these are completely
different sections and could act alone. This shows versatility and it&rsquo;s
something you don&rsquo;t expect which can be startling but in the long run,
effective.</p><p>Well done Mr. Bowman. Take a bow.</p>

Very well done. The new mark is reminiscent of the previous, however, this one is fresher and more bold. The type treatment on the logo is quite interesting as well. Playful but doesn&rsquo;t set itself apart from the mark. Balancing the logo and name can be very challenging but Douglas shows no hesitation. Next I was drawn too is the white space. I loooove whitespace. When it&rsquo;s used properly your eye floats through the design, appreciating subtleties rather than getting lost in eye candy. I miss the color palate Douglas used on the old site. Providing a distinguishing design element like color to set apart different sections can be very pleasing. Overall, well done. I&rsquo;m anxious to see Stopdesign&rsquo;s evolution.</p><p>On to Dave Shea&rsquo;s<a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Mezzoblue</a> version 4. Lots of things going on in this redesign. I could tell from reading his post and exploring the navigation that a lot has gone into the programing side of things. However, on the front end I think too much is going on. The color scheme works well but the style is confusing. I can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s shooting for the &ldquo;pixel&rdquo; style or something I haven&rsquo;t seen before. The navigation is different and nice. Everything contained in three tabs expanding into additional tabs that give corresponding information. Efficient way of stacking content into a small space. I also enjoy the reply<a href="http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/05/25/reply_highli/">highlighting</a>. The overall structure of the site is well thought out and well executed, however, more time needs to be spent on the purpose and meaning of the design elements.</p><p><a href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/">Hillman Curtis</a> quoted Hemingway in an interview saying:</p><blockquote><p>Write the story, take out all the good lines and see if the story still works. What he&rsquo;s saying is write your story. Take out all the fancy stuff. The stuff you think is so great. All the descriptions, all the adjectives, all the beautiful stuff; yank it all out of there. See if you have a story. The beauty of it for me, being a designer, is actually watching my design come to life as I pull stuff out, not add stuff in.</p></blockquote><p>I reflect on this quote frequently throughout my design process to help gauge when I&rsquo;ve done too much or to little. I hope this critique helps in some way. I miss formal critiques and I plan on doing more.</p>

The book was initially published in 1875 as an inspirational guide for designers. Dresser was most notable for his contributions to the Victorian era with his intricately designed textiles, furniture and ceramics. The following are passages I felt like sharing.</p><blockquote><p>Decorations, to be satisfying to the educated, must manifest knowledge&hellip; for unless the decoration is done wisely as well as with understanding , it may yet fail to please those who are best able to appreciate good ornament.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In all attempts at the production of what is new, there is a danger of being extreme, eccentric, or unrefined.</p></blockquote><p>Study, I say, whatever has gone before; not with the view of becoming a copyist, but with the object of gaining knowledge, and of seeking out general truths and broad principles, which will serve you as they have served the noble and good in times long past.</p><p>Dresser&rsquo;s inspiration can be seen in many<a href="http://www.squidfingers.com/patterns/">different</a><a href="http://www.24-7media.de/ingram/">forms</a> of current works. I spent some time in Greenwich Village studying iron fence decorations that reflect the same victorian style Dresser pioneered.</p>

Not your typical exhibition where you study lavish master works. The topic was Minimalism and, at first, I was somewhat timid; this being my virgin modernist exhibition. I began reading the blocks of text describing each piece while the people next too me stared hopelessly into blank canvases. I was fascinated.</p><blockquote><p>&hellip;unique economy of formal means to explore the aesthetic potential of pure shape, structure, and surface. To annul all sense of illusion, artist associated with minimalism often relied on mathematical systems; manifested in serial repetition or the use of a grid; as a guiding compositional grid.</p></blockquote><p>I briefly studied the Modernist movement in college, never giving it due attention. Many criticize this period as being meaningless or a waste of talent. I&rsquo;ve found it to be much more. The amount of thought and planning behind modern work is astonishing, inspiration stemming from obscure sources.</p><blockquote><p>Mangold would use the negative space of nature to create geometric forms.</p></blockquote><p>Their purpose wasn&rsquo;t to satisfy viewers, it was the deconstruction of Art. Taking all that was familiar to art and dismantling it. Exposing its underpinnings. This was something that had not been done publicly. Similar too opening the back of a watch to reveal the complexity and simplicity behind the movement of three spinning hands on a circular form.</p><blockquote><p>Minimalism&rsquo;s immediate impact upon development of contemporary art explored a range of concerns including process, the dematerialization of the object, the performative nature of art, and the structural properties of light.</p></blockquote><p>This deconstruction is merely a process to better understand Art. The more an Artist understands the underpinnings of their creations, the better they can serve their purpose.</p><p>The following are Minimalist Artists that are worth understanding:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_3.html">Carl Andre</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_46.html">Dan Flavin</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_97.html">Robert Mangold</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_70.html">Donald Judd</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_101.html">Brice Marden</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_87A.html">Sol LeWitt</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_103.html">Agnes Martin</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_115.html">Robert Morris</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_140.html">Robert Ryman</a></li></ul><p>All of the above quotes were taken from the &ldquo;Singular Forms&rdquo; Exhibition in the Solomon R.

Some really<a href="http://www.whitney.org/american_voices/541/index.html">small</a>, some so big they take up the entire entry way like the one in<a href="http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?56253+0+0">Washington D.C.&rsquo;s Museum of Contemporary Art</a>. Each of them related with very different personalities. They are always moving ever so softly through the stagnate museum air. Always changing shape and balance prompting me to stop dead in my tracks, mesmerized. Photos in books do these works no justice; they must be witnessed in person in order to fully feel their presents and infinite tango with the shadows.</p><p>Calder was really on to something.
