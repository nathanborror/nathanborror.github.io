<h3>Sunday, July 1, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>How does a machine have soul? We could try and answer by throwing around terms like usefulness, elegance and grace but all our attempts would sound prosaic next to the device I recently became acquainted with. Run and hide Crackberry, the iPhone is here.
For people to be drooling over a 4.8 ounce device is not unfathomable especially coming from Apple. This is different. During my first hours with the iPhone I literally felt nervous.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/waves-creativity/>The waves of creativity</a></h2>
<h3>Thursday, May 17, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>There are a lot of environmental factors that go into fostering a creative environment. As creative persons mature, we become more in-tune with what works best for us when it&rsquo;s time to dream up new ideas and solutions. Some of us trek to coffeehouses while others listen to Bach, Satie or Mogwai. Whatever we do we&rsquo;re all essentially trying to achieve a certain state of mind.
Before I go any further here is a quick explanation of the human brain by neuronal scientist, Richard Restak (/people/richard-m-restak/):</p>

<h3>Sunday, May 6, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I just finished reading chapter three of Convergence Culture (/library/books/convergence-culture/) where Jenkins discusses transmedia storytelling. He focuses on the Matrix franchise and how it basically rewrote the rules for Hollywoods future. It got me thinking on my walk home from the coffeehouse, why aren&rsquo;t newspapers doing this?
We&rsquo;re all familiar with the Matrix and have varying depths of involvement with it. Most of us have seen the first film, some the second and third but have any of us played the video game, or seen the Animatrix, or been to Matrix Online (http://www.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/ljworld-redesign/>LJWorld redesign</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, May 2, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>So for the past five months or so we&rsquo;ve been working on a redesign for the Lawrence Journal-World. For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a daily newspaper that circulates the town of Lawrence, Kansas. It&rsquo;s quite small compared to surrounding markets which makes it very agile and free from shareholders and their evil agendas.
I had a feeling this project would be special and challenging but I had no idea of the scale.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/javascript-flash-round-2/>Javascript Flash round 2</a></h2>
<h3>Friday, April 20, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>FIguring out the Javascript/Flash integration kit has lead to a much simpler solution. Looks like Macromedia has slipped in another nugget of usefulness in the Flash 8 release which, I might add, has penetrated the market remarkably fast. It&rsquo;s called External Interface. I gotta thank Bobby for finding this one.
So forget the last post if you&rsquo;re a progressive designer like myself, marching to the Flash 8 bugle. Using the same example as before replace your Actionscript with the following.</p>

<h3>Thursday, April 19, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>In a past life I used to build admin tools using Ruby on Rails. I thoroughly enjoyed spending weekends improving my little tools and libraries but I eventually realized I was spending more time on back-end stuff than front-end. Enter Django. For the past nine months I&rsquo;ve touched nothing but Django so you can imagine how easy it was for me to hop on the Rails bicycle when Dreamhost decided to upgrade Rails.</p>

<h3>Wednesday, April 11, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard wisperings about the death of blogs lately. More and more we see our favorite writters fading into the ether. This begs the question, what next? What do we do with the barren ghost towns that once thrived on eager readers making sure their cache was cleared before stalking their favorites.
Personal sites should be cornucopias which chronicle our lives. They should be open sketchbooks crammed with a maze of twists and turns.</p>

<h3>Tuesday, March 27, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Why does old content have to fade so quickly? Blogs, zines, news articles all suffer from &ldquo;out with the old, in with the new&rdquo; mentality. There is a lot of old content that retains relevancy far beyond its publish date. The problem is, how do we resurrect it?
Simple, stats tracking. Amazon solved this problem a long time ago. They meticulously track peoples browsing and buying habits and offer up recommendations based on trends.</p>

<h3>Sunday, March 18, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Yes its true. You can make Javascript and Flash play together! Way back in 2005 the company formerly known as Macromedia threw together a nice little kit to make these two languages play nicely. Here&rsquo;s how.
First we need to secure some crutial files. The first is a SWF called JavaScriptFlashGateway.swf which allows us to setup a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; between our Flash and Javascript. Second, make sure you link up JavaScriptFlashGateway.js. Third, put JavaScriptSerializer.</p>

<h2><a href=https://nathan.run/posts/2007/not-so-convergant/>Not so convergent</a></h2>
<h3>Wednesday, March 14, 2007</h3>
<div class=summary>
<p>Talking about &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; is like talking about &ldquo;the war on terror.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re two incredibly broad terms with unforeseeable outcomes. Convergence has been vogue for a while and I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about its usage to describe media convergence. At this years SXSW, for the first time, someone summed up what I&rsquo;ve been trying to understand.
When I think of convergence I do so in terms of the classic media outlets converging with the Internet.</p>
