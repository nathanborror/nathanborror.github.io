  # iPhone dead; $30 rental?

  This morning I woke up on my own. Normally I hear little crickets chirping around 7am which is my [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone) letting me know it's time to face the coming day. This morning, no crickets. At first I thought maybe the battery was flat, but that's not possible. I charged it the day before and didn't put it through any rigorous usage. So [iPhone CPR](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305743) commences.

  First I try a hard restart, holding down the home and on/off button for a few seconds. No dice. Then I plug it in, nothing, another hard restart, nothing. Let it sit for a while plugged in, restart, nothing. She's flat-lined and any amount of resuscitation is not getting her little heart pumping again. By this point it's time for work.

  I roll into work around 9am with a cold iPhone in my pocket. She still feels good but her soul is lost. 10am rolls around, I can't wait. I head to Apple Store on the Plaza hoping they can shock her back into existence. The Genius looks it over, does exactly what I did earlier that morning. Realizes he can't do much so offers to send it back to Apple for repair. This sucks, two days sans phone is not acceptable. I've never had to send a phone in for repairs, I've never had a phone just break. I _need_ a phone at all times. I can't say for sure if this is Apple's fault but I know for a fact that I have not done anything out of the ordinary to cause my iPhone to die. So I'm forced to pay $30 to rent a phone while mine is being repaired. This is lame.
  Apple shouldn't be charging it's loyal $30 to rent an iPhone while theirs is being repaired, especially if the error is on Apple. This doesn't seem like good customer service to me. I would gladly put down a deposit for the rental but I should get that deposit back.

  While my phone travels in her temporary sarcophagus to the bowels of Cupertino I'm left with the sting of loosing $30 for an error that is undoubtedly Apples. **grumble**
  I would like to thank the guys at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/countryclubplaza/" title="Apple Store, Country Club Plaza">Apple Store</a>, they were very cordial and accommodating.

  ## Update: August 28, 2007

  I recieved my "fixed" phone in the mail via Apple. Only problem was the little guy refused to recognize my SIM card. I tried all sorts of things, even other SIM cards, nothing. Apple was kind enough to replace the phone. What a relief. After about two weeks of usage things were back to normal until this evening while browsing the web I was greeted with a colorful half streaked screen. I don't know about anyone else but the Aurora Borealis belongs in the sky, not on the lower half of my iPhone screen. My luck just gets better by the iPhone.
