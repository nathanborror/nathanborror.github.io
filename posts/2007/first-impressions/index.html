<p>How does a machine have soul? We could try and answer by throwing around terms like usefulness, elegance and grace but all our attempts would sound prosaic next to the device I recently became acquainted with. Run and hide Crackberry, the iPhone is here.</p>
<p>For people to be drooling over a 4.8 ounce device is not unfathomable especially coming from Apple. This is different. During my first hours with the iPhone I literally felt nervous. I felt like I didn&rsquo;t deserve this, it seemed unreal.</p>
<p>11:00am Saturday: Headed to the coffee house. Do I need my laptop or my notebook, or magazine? Was I really walking down the street listening to my phone? Wait&mldr; Whoa&mldr; phone call. <em>Pinch</em> Hello&mldr; <em>conversation</em> goodbye. Music!!!</p>
<p>Some of my friends think I&rsquo;m crazy but for a UI designer this is as close to nirvana as I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>9:00pm Saturday: Driving to the liquor store. Wait, are they open? iPhone eight ball returns: <a href=http://www2.ljworld.com/marketplace/businesses/mass-beverage/>decidedly so</a>. Again&mldr; I&rsquo;m not worthy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those little knowledge cracks in your life are slowly getting sealed. Anything you wanted or needed to know is now within a few gestures. Why remember? Leave it up to the cloud, let your iPhone be your Receiver.</p>
<p>This device represents a new bar for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction>HCI</a>. It also poses many exciting questions and possibilities. My only hope is that Apple will offer an SDK in the coming months so the collective can contribute. I have confidence the will. Need we be reminded where cover-flow came from? We definitely can&rsquo;t rely on the browser sandbox. It doesn&rsquo;t offer the same grace and fluidity applications garner.</p>
