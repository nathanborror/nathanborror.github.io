<p>Adobe just <a href=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/120407adobemoviestar.html>released</a> Update 3 of Flash Player 9. This is HUGE. Streaming video is no longer a laughing matter. Streaming High Definition video will become common place and it starts today.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about BlueRay and HD-DVD, but what they don&rsquo;t realize is they&rsquo;ve already been obsolesced before catching stride. VHS is dead, brick and mortar video rental is on life support, and DVD just checked in with chest pains.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-it-take>How long will it take?</h2>
<p>I give Adobe four months to capture 80% of the market share. It usually takes about a year to cover 90% of the web with a new Flash version, but once YouTube and MySpace deliver, the game&rsquo;s over.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-this-mean>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>It means you can cancel your cable. I recently did because I&rsquo;m getting most of my content from iTunes and YouTube. I paid around $100 a month for cable and watched nothing worthwhile. Now I could <strong>own</strong> around fifty shows a month for the same price &ndash; not to mention most of the stuff I like is free. Let&rsquo;s also not forget the portability factor :)
This is a huge step forward in providing tools to people who need them. Now go <a href=http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer>upgrade</a>.</p>
