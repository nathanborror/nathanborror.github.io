Manovich discusses the methods in which we access new\nmedia. He mentions some research done by Paul Virilio on the collapsing effect\ntechnology has on the distances between people and content. Before, if a person\nwanted to see the works of Da Vinci they\u0026rsquo;d have to travel to a book store or an\nart museum.

Using them has allowed me to achieve\nsome effects that were next to impossible with JPEGs and GIFs. The biggest\nhurdle in using PNGs is their file size. The export tools in Photoshop tie your\nhands behind your back, not allowing you to tweak anything that may lead to a\nmore compact file. Until Photoshop adds some functionality I think I may have a\nhandy solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand the solution we need to understand the composition of a PNG. The\nmost popular use case for PNG is it\u0026rsquo;s levels of transparency (or alpha channel),\n256 to be exact. Along with this it has a 24bit color palate. In photoshop there\nare two settings in Save for Web, 8bit PNG and 24bit PNG. The 24bit is most\ndesirable because it enables the alpha channel. The PNG format has many many\nother features but I\u0026rsquo;m only going to focus on these few to move this post along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we can deduce from the above that we have an image with two qualities, 24bit\ncolor and 256 alpha channel. Both are being compressed somewhat independently.\nThe only problem is, Photoshop doesn\u0026rsquo;t let us change the compression on the\n24bit part or on the alpha channel part. If we focus on compressing the 24bit\npart we can potentially shave off a lot of the fat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this example I\u0026rsquo;m going to use a box that has a lot of texture and a drop\nshadow. To compress the inside part that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a drop shadow I\u0026rsquo;m simply\ngoing to select it, copy it, create a new document and paste it in. Then I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to use Save for Web to export it as a JPEG and use the photoshop\ncompression tools to make it an acceptable file size. Then I\u0026rsquo;m going to open my\ncompressed JPEG that I just saved and copy it into my original document. After\nlining things up with the compressed JPEG on top I\u0026rsquo;m now ready to Save for Web\nand use the PNG 24bit compression. The results are pretty dramatic.

After about two weeks of usage things were back to normal until this evening while browsing the web I was greeted with a colorful half streaked screen. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about anyone else but the Aurora Borealis belongs in the sky, not on the lower half of my iPhone screen. My luck just gets better by the iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},{"title":"Blueprints are not final","date_published":"2007-08-10T00:00:00-0800","date_modified":"2007-08-10T00:00:00-0800","id":"https://nathan.run/posts/2007/blueprints-are-not-final/","url":"https://nathan.run/posts/2007/blueprints-are-not-final/","content_html":"\u003cp\u003eSo apparently a little framework called Blueprint (\u003ca href=\"http://bjorkoy.com/blueprint\"\u003ehttp://bjorkoy.com/blueprint\u003c/a\u003e)\nhas reared it\u0026rsquo;s head, born from a few stylesheets that look very familiar. I\u0026rsquo;m\nsomewhat conflicted with its release because I don\u0026rsquo;t think it should be used.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s great, but don\u0026rsquo;t use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout five or so months ago I was working on the Journal-World (\u003ca href=\"http://www.ljworld.com\"\u003ehttp://www.ljworld.com\u003c/a\u003e)\nredesign. News sites tend to be very column heavy and I was getting tired of\nwriting the same code over and over to accommodate for my design iterations.\nOne day Jeff (\u003ca href=\"http://www.jeffcroft.com\"\u003ehttp://www.jeffcroft.com\u003c/a\u003e) and I discussed some ways to maximized\ncode reuse and speed up this process of going from Photoshop to markup. Later\nthat night I sketched out a method for easily defining grid structures and\ncolumns. My attempt was pretty crude and over the next week or so it become a\nlot more solid with the help of Jeff and Christian (\u003ca href=\"http://mintchaos.com/)\"\u003ehttp://mintchaos.com/)\u003c/a\u003e.\nAfter adding styles for type and common lists we had formed a pretty powerful\ntime saving solution. I could quickly prototype mockups in hours. The only\nproblem was it wasn\u0026rsquo;t semantic. Things like span-4, unit, and block polluted\nthe HTML and CSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I was okay with this because my focus was getting the redesign on the\nright track, however, looking back it was the wrong decision. Un-semantic code\ngoes against everything the Standards movement has fought for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I shed a tear? No. I\u0026rsquo;m not an elitist in this area anymore and I don\u0026rsquo;t go\nsniffing for validation errors because I value usability, style and harmony\nmore. But, the blatant un-semantic-ness of this framework still disgusts me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was quite surprised and sickened to find out Olav launched this almost\nidentical framework, Blueprint. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s great for prototyping\nbut don\u0026rsquo;t settle for it. Good semantic names are worth every penny. Also,\nframeworks don\u0026rsquo;t belong in markup languages. They just don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]}
