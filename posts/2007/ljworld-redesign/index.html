<p>So for the past five months or so we&rsquo;ve been working on a redesign for the <a href=http://ljworld.com>Lawrence Journal-World</a>. For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a daily newspaper that circulates the town of Lawrence, Kansas. It&rsquo;s quite small compared to surrounding markets which makes it very agile and free from shareholders and their evil agendas.</p>
<p>I had a feeling this project would be special and challenging but I had no idea of the scale. Turns out, around the same time I was tasked with designing <a href=http://ljworld.com/marketplace>Marketplace</a>, a directory of 4000+ local businesses. I must also mention, news doesn&rsquo;t stop for redesigns. It&rsquo;s definitely a juggling act when your trying to complete a site thats constantly having to push out news features and various timely events like <a href=http://www2.ljworld.com/elections/2007/apr/03/races/lawrence_city_commission/>local elections</a>. There were, shall I say, growing pains.
Details aside, the design is <a href=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/politics/kansas_legislature/>simple</a>. In fact the design is designed to disappear. Content is what really matters so I decided to take an approach that would make the overall design feel supportive rather than overbearing. This isn&rsquo;t easy for anyone and requires extreme discipline. Discipline I never thought I had.</p>
<p>The site will continue to take shape over time. We&rsquo;re hoping that redesigns are a thing of the past and constant iterations are a thing of the future. We&rsquo;ll see how long that lasts ;-)
This project wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the involvement of <a href=http://www.b-list.org/>James Bennett</a>, Dan Cox, <a href=http://www.jeffcroft.com/>Jeff Croft</a>, <a href=http://postneo.com/>Matt Croydon</a>, <a href=http://www.jacobian.org/>Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, Joel Mathis, <a href=http://www.mintchaos.com/>Christian Metts</a>, David Ryan, Tom Tobin, all the web producers and all the editors and reporters that allow us to do what we do.</p>
