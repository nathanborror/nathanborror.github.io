  # Austin bound

  I'm headed to Austin, Texas today to partake in the South by Southwest festivities. The panel linup this year looks scrumptious. Unlike my pal [Jeff](http://www2.jeffcroft.com/blog/2007/mar/01/where-find-me-sxsw/), I have no idea what I'll be attending. I will, however, be attending as many evening parties as I can possibly stumble into. I'll definitely be attending the [AMODA](http://www.amoda.org/) Digital Showcase, which was fantastic last year, and the Austin On Rails Happy Hour sporting my [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) shirt no less. I also highly recommend Drinks with Lifehacker, those dudes know how to party.

  Hope to see some of you there. If we've never met don't hesitate to introduce yourself. My [SXSW Flickr stream](http://flickr.com/photos/sketch22/sets/72157594576670321/) should be dripping with nightly photos or join the [Flickr pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/sxswi2007/).

  Oh yeah, if I see any of you at the Happy Hour Sponsored by Microsoft Expression Studio, I may have to hurt you.
