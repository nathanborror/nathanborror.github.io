<h1>Exhausting a Place</h1>
<p><em>Georges Perec's, <a href="http://readernaut.com/books/0984115528/">An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris</a> got me thinking about all the undocumented experiences lost while simply sitting in a coffeehouse. This is my attempt to capture those mundane and special moments.</em></p>

A group of phones.<br>
A man with his legs crossed outside talking to someone worthy.<br>
One phone hands another a battery.<br>
A barista showing some girls how to brew coffee wearing the same shirt I happened to buy yesterday.<br>
A line forms.<br>
A dozen roses graces our view.<br>
Reflections of people in the glass scurry in all directions.<p>
