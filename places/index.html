<p>It&rsquo;s Wednesday, August 1, 2018 ‚Äî¬†3:26 PM<br>
An artist draws frantically before his scene vanishes<br>
The struggle for chairs is neverending<br>
A pitch ensues, testing the resolve of its recipients<br>
A moment of blue as the fog teases us with a sun that never left<br>
The oldest at one end of the bar, the youngest at the other share a moment<br>
A rolex stares intently into his laptop, searching for the next move<br>
Muni turns confidently onto Jackson<br>
Rush subsides, exhale</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Sunday, September 30, 2012 ‚Äî 2:21 PM<br>
Sunny, warm<br>
A group of phones<br>
A man with his legs crossed outside talking to someone worthy<br>
One phone hands another a battery<br>
A barista showing some girls how to brew coffee wearing the same shirt I happened to buy yesterday<br>
A line forms<br>
A dozen roses graces our view<br>
Reflections of people in the glass scurry in all directions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Sunday, September 30, 2012 ‚Äî 10:21 AM<br>
Sunny, cool<br>
A man impatiently waits for his bagel to toast after being chastised for requiring more butter<br>
A family of two smart phones, a tablet, and a laptop<br>
A buzz as more tourists awake<br>
A holding pin of anxious customers congregates at the end of the bar anticipating their fix<br>
A woman falsely reacts to the baristas commanding announcements<br>
A new woman seeks dominance over the crowd, she&rsquo;s met with scowls<br>
A runner couple compare products<br>
Occasional eye contact, &ldquo;are you writing about me?&rdquo; Yes<br>
A woman stares at her laptop, patiently waiting for it to load having not personalized what an interaction designer somewhere thought should be personalized<br>
A guy who went to Berkeley and wishes everyone to know.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Saturday, September 29, 2012 ‚Äî 12:36 PM<br>
Cloudy, warm<br>
Dedicated baristas making espresso and small talk with the tourists‚Äîchoosing their battles wisely<br>
A manager playing jokes on tourists to win them over<br>
A tailored couple making a tailored exit<br>
Two life-long elderly friends enjoying each other in silence<br>
Three asian teenagers sitting at a table but actually sitting in completely different worlds as their faces glow from the handheld screens in-front of them<br>
A dominant gesticulator<br>
A man plugs his phone in over a panini<br>
A tasting group in the back acclimating themselves to the role of connoisseur<br>
Old wooden chairs loosely attached to their tables showing their character<br>
A cement floor dutifully absorbing all that is lost once entering a coffeehouse<br>
Artwork hung with arrogance (too high).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Saturday, September 22, 2012 ‚Äî 1:32 PM<br>
Sunny, warm<br>
A woman holding a beer with the tips of her fingers as if it were socially unacceptable in her current situation<br>
A proud server casing the outside tables after making deliveries to receptive guests<br>
A middle aged couple sharing a smart(phone) moment<br>
A boy walking up the sidewalk intently focused on a handheld game while disrupting the flow of sidewalk tourism<br>
A girl at an outside table, alone in a sea of social interactions desperately trying to create one of her own while feeling the warmth of technology next to her cheek<br>
A mom guiding her children while the lawn ornament she&rsquo;s holding spins wildly.</p>
