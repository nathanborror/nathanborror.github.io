<p>Missing the days when expressing some opinions didn&rsquo;t feel worrisome — expressing opinions as a means to learn or grow in the absence of judgement. I really shouldn&rsquo;t be distracting myself with things that ultimately don&rsquo;t effect me but there&rsquo;s a natural instinct to care.</p>

<p>If you ignore all the reasons software makers need to be incentivized to build good software and create sustainable businesses — how would an operating system look if it was designed to be more composable. If most use-cases we have today remained, could they be better served under the UNIX philosophy?</p>

<p>Lots of productive one-on-ones at work reminding me how underrated good old fashion phone calls are. Cleaned up the apartment while Nate was at her moms and finished 12 Rules for Life. I mostly enjoyed it even though some find him controversial. He&rsquo;s just trying to help people confront chaotic situations with thought exercises. The bit about anti-humanism has stuck with me.</p>

<p>Catching up on work. I&rsquo;ve really fallen off the wagon with regards to keeping my news and twitter consumption to a minimum during the week. To combat some serious Clubhouse FOMO I wanted to see if I could create a DVR-like tool. Tried to watch their traffic but it looks like they&rsquo;re pinning their SSL cert. Found a guy who <a href=https://github.com/Seia-Soto/clubhouse-api>figured out some endpoints</a> but hasn&rsquo;t figured out how to stream audio.</p>

<p>Discovering a bunch of covers I had not heard. James Blake recorded <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-the-partys-over/1543116280?i=1543116286">when the party&rsquo;s over</a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/godspeed/1543116280?i=1543116293">Godspeed</a> — both beautiful but too much like their originals. Unlike this recording of <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/waterfalls/1547871262?i=1547871267">Waterfalls</a> which is uniquely Death Cab. A good cover sounds lyrically familiar with new distinct ownership.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame Vic Chestnut isn&rsquo;t around to enjoy these covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/flirted-with-you-all-my-life/1547871262?i=1547871494">Death Cab</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If I could bid on artists to record covers I&rsquo;d totally throw some money behind Ben Gibbard, Jenny Lewis and Jimmy Tamborello recording Phil Collins hits.</p>

<p>Thinking about scaffolds this morning and how important they are to progress. Kabat-Zinn explains how focusing on the breadth is a scaffold for meditation, meditation is a scaffold for awareness and in many ways awareness is a scaffold for a better relationship with nature and a more equitable relationship with each other. He says if we don&rsquo;t heed the cliche, "we are standing on the shoulders of giants" then we&rsquo;ll face a more difficult journey pushing beyond the scaffolds put before us.</p>

<p>I wonder how much censorship needs to happen before we see more advancements in decentralized systems, or are decentralized systems just always inherently difficult? How far out is a future where we don&rsquo;t need radio towers?</p>

<p>Had a quiet, regimented day feeling more aware and present than normal. I think warm tea helps me slow down and pay attention.</p>
<p>Attempted to cut some mat board. Planned out a complicated six photo mount and forgot how easy a mat cutter can get away from you. Scrapped my efforts and will try again tomorrow with a little more patience.</p>
<p>Watched a few <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explained_%28TV_series%29>Explained</a> episodes on Netflix. They&rsquo;re good hits that send you googling. The Beauty episode and how dementia patients responded to art was thought provoking. Got me wondering if we could better quantify the importance of art in our wellbeing.</p>
