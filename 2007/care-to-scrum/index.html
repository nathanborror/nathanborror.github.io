<p>We need more scrums and less meetings. A scrum (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting</a>)
is a 5-10 minute stand-up meeting. About 80% of the meetings I&rsquo;ve ever attended
have included at least five people. Any meeting over three becomes a presentation
while one bloviates and others wander.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since my last scrum. It included seven people, complete
participation, no dominance, one referee, and was contained within a 10 minute
package. Rather than walking away in a typical post-meeting cloud of confusion,
I left the scrum feeling clear and informed. It was the best mode of collaborative
communication I&rsquo;ve been a part of. Again, I say more scrums, less meetings.</p>
