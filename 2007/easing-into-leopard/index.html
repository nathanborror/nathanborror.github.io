<p>I&rsquo;m a UI geek and the first thing I noticed during the iPhone demo was how fun scrolling seems. With small devices and even regular sized computers a majority of our time is spent scrolling various collections of content. Only a company like Apple can step back, recognize this, and make it fun. This will no doubt engage users, bringing them closer to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>flow</a>.</p>
<p>Easing has been around a long time. I remember learning how to do it in Flash with the aid of <a href=http://www.joshuadavis.com/>Joshua Davis</a>. You could fling that scroll bar right across the screen and have to bounce right back. Then <a href=http://www.robertpenner.com/>Robert Penner</a> made everyones life easier with his ubiquitous easing equations.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but imagine this new iPhone UI hinted at a lot of what we&rsquo;ll be seeing in Leopard. I don&rsquo;t know if everyone would want easing in Leopard but, if done right, it could bring to life a hella fun interface. It might also help some of us that design huge content sites :)</p>
