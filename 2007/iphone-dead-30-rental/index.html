<p>This morning I woke up on my own. Normally I hear little crickets chirping around 7am which is my <a href=http://www.apple.com/iphone>iPhone</a> letting me know it&rsquo;s time to face the coming day. This morning, no crickets. At first I thought maybe the battery was flat, but that&rsquo;s not possible. I charged it the day before and didn&rsquo;t put it through any rigorous usage. So <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305743">iPhone CPR</a> commences.</p>
<p>First I try a hard restart, holding down the home and on/off button for a few seconds. No dice. Then I plug it in, nothing, another hard restart, nothing. Let it sit for a while plugged in, restart, nothing. She&rsquo;s flat-lined and any amount of resuscitation is not getting her little heart pumping again. By this point it&rsquo;s time for work.</p>
<p>I roll into work around 9am with a cold iPhone in my pocket. She still feels good but her soul is lost. 10am rolls around, I can&rsquo;t wait. I head to Apple Store on the Plaza hoping they can shock her back into existence. The Genius looks it over, does exactly what I did earlier that morning. Realizes he can&rsquo;t do much so offers to send it back to Apple for repair. This sucks, two days sans phone is not acceptable. I&rsquo;ve never had to send a phone in for repairs, I&rsquo;ve never had a phone just break. I <em>need</em> a phone at all times. I can&rsquo;t say for sure if this is Apple&rsquo;s fault but I know for a fact that I have not done anything out of the ordinary to cause my iPhone to die. So I&rsquo;m forced to pay $30 to rent a phone while mine is being repaired. This is lame.
Apple shouldn&rsquo;t be charging it&rsquo;s loyal $30 to rent an iPhone while theirs is being repaired, especially if the error is on Apple. This doesn&rsquo;t seem like good customer service to me. I would gladly put down a deposit for the rental but I should get that deposit back.</p>
<p>While my phone travels in her temporary sarcophagus to the bowels of Cupertino I&rsquo;m left with the sting of loosing $30 for an error that is undoubtedly Apples. <strong>grumble</strong>
I would like to thank the guys at the Apple Store, they were very cordial and accommodating.</p>

<p>I recieved my &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; phone in the mail via Apple. Only problem was the little guy refused to recognize my SIM card. I tried all sorts of things, even other SIM cards, nothing. Apple was kind enough to replace the phone. What a relief. After about two weeks of usage things were back to normal until this evening while browsing the web I was greeted with a colorful half streaked screen. I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else but the Aurora Borealis belongs in the sky, not on the lower half of my iPhone screen. My luck just gets better by the iPhone.</p>
