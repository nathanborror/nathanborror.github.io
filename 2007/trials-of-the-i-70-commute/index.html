<p>A while ago I began working back in the big city while remaining in modest
Lawrence. This required a 40 min. x 2 drive into the sun five days a week. It
wasn&rsquo;t so bad at first, but the race through traffic and mass of incandescent
gas started taking its toll.</p>
<p>I decided to evaluate what was wearing me out. The sun, for one, was melting my
retinas and giving me headaches. This stress could easily be eliminated with the
right shades, polarized to be exact. They immediately reduced eye strain and
lowered my stress level. I was still experiencing anxiety that led to being
drained at work and home. This had to be stemming from my colleagues on the road.</p>
<p>Driving I-70 during rush hour is like threading a needle. You&rsquo;re constantly
struggling to out-pace traffic so you can relax and cruise the rest of the way
home. Only problem is your cruising doesn&rsquo;t happen until the last 10-15 miles.
I averaged 80 to 85 mph and decided one day just go the speed limit, 70 mph.</p>
<p>The results were immediate. I didn&rsquo;t have to pass anyone! That alone leveled my
stress. Then I realized I wasn&rsquo;t getting into any traffic jams because they were
all hurdling past me. I could hold a steady cruising speed without having to
touch my brake. This also upped my miles per gallon giving me an extra trip on
a full tank.</p>
<p>The irony was seeing everyone who passed me at the toll booth or the first
stoplight, so I knew I wasn&rsquo;t losing any time.</p>
<p>After spreading the word about this revelation, a coworker was telling me about
some research comparing fluid dynamics and traffic waves (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_wave)>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_wave)</a>.
The Wikipedia page describes it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deeper understanding of traffic waves is a goal of the physical study of
traffic flow. When looking at traffic waves, the traffic itself can often be
looked at in a manner of fluid dynamics. It has been said that by knowing how
traffic waves are created, drivers can sometimes reduce their effects by
increasing vehicle headways and reducing the use of brakes, ultimately
alleviating traffic congestion for everyone in the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to my dear fellow I-70 commuters, you don&rsquo;t have to thank me; but just
remember who&rsquo;s making your life easier. See you at the toll booth!</p>
