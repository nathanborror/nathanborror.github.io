<p>So apparently a little framework called Blueprint (<a href=http://bjorkoy.com/blueprint>http://bjorkoy.com/blueprint</a>)
has reared it&rsquo;s head, born from a few stylesheets that look very familiar. I&rsquo;m
somewhat conflicted with its release because I don&rsquo;t think it should be used.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s great, but don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>About five or so months ago I was working on the Journal-World (<a href=http://www.ljworld.com>http://www.ljworld.com</a>)
redesign. News sites tend to be very column heavy and I was getting tired of
writing the same code over and over to accommodate for my design iterations.
One day Jeff (<a href=http://www.jeffcroft.com>http://www.jeffcroft.com</a>) and I discussed some ways to maximized
code reuse and speed up this process of going from Photoshop to markup. Later
that night I sketched out a method for easily defining grid structures and
columns. My attempt was pretty crude and over the next week or so it become a
lot more solid with the help of Jeff and Christian (<a href=http://mintchaos.com/)>http://mintchaos.com/)</a>.
After adding styles for type and common lists we had formed a pretty powerful
time saving solution. I could quickly prototype mockups in hours. The only
problem was it wasn&rsquo;t semantic. Things like span-4, unit, and block polluted
the HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>At first I was okay with this because my focus was getting the redesign on the
right track, however, looking back it was the wrong decision. Un-semantic code
goes against everything the Standards movement has fought for.</p>
<p>Do I shed a tear? No. I&rsquo;m not an elitist in this area anymore and I don&rsquo;t go
sniffing for validation errors because I value usability, style and harmony
more. But, the blatant un-semantic-ness of this framework still disgusts me.</p>
<p>So I was quite surprised and sickened to find out Olav launched this almost
identical framework, Blueprint. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s great for prototyping
but don&rsquo;t settle for it. Good semantic names are worth every penny. Also,
frameworks don&rsquo;t belong in markup languages. They just don&rsquo;t.</p>
