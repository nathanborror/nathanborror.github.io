<p>I wanna discuss rating systems for a bit. From what I gather there are three
flavors: a simple &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method, a thumbs up or down, and the scale. Each
solutions goal is to find out what people think of your content. This is helpful
when trying to understand your audience.</p>
<h1 id=the-one-vote-method>The &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method</h1>
<p>As simple as it gets. If someone likes a piece of content they simply click a
button saying so. Nothing more nothing less. This is a visceral response, a
&ldquo;blink&rdquo; reaction which requires minimal thought. The downside is you can&rsquo;t infer
that a non-vote means people dislike content. A non-vote most likely means they
didn&rsquo;t read the content enough to care which could suggest weak content but it&rsquo;s
a little grey.</p>
<h1 id=thumbs-up-thumbs-down>Thumbs up, thumbs down</h1>
<p>This one makes me think of Siskel and Ebert and their black and white critiques
of film. Probably the most widely used style because of its simplicity. Like
the &ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method, it relies on gut reactions but allows people to express
their dislike for a piece of content. The style sometimes borrows the
visualization side of the scale system below.</p>
<h1 id=scale>Scale</h1>
<p>Frequently represented as stars, we commonly see this method used along with
reviews and entertainment ratings. This system requires the most amount of
thought from a person which often leads to poor return. It&rsquo;s best used in
situations where a person is investing time into writing a review.</p>
<h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Implementing a rating system isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart. You need to be
comfortable with powers of online democracy. Oddly enough rating systems are
why Google works. They&rsquo;re Page Rank system is based almost entirely on the
&ldquo;one vote&rdquo; method where a link from one site to another stands as a &ldquo;vote.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Democracy on the web works."](<a href=http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html>http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html</a>)
