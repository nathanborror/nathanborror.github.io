<li>☕️ Highwire on Solano</li>
<li>🍕 Cheeseboard run for tonight</li>
<li>☕️ Wrecking Ball on Shattuck</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy day in Berkeley. Got a bunch of food for tonight and hung some posters for our missing runner friend, Lucas. Researched some zero degree bags for some potential winter adventures.</p>
<ul>
<li>🏃‍♂️ Campus out-and-back six</li>

<li>☕️ Temple at home</li>
<li>☕️ Andytown on Tarval</li>
<li>🚶‍♂️ Long Outer Sunset walk</li>
</ul>
<p>Drove to San Francisco to get a COVID test so we can spend some time with Nate’s mom over New Years. Did some wandering. The City has such a weird vibe when I come back, for some reason I expect what I’m used to even though the circumstances are unchanged.</p>

<li>🧘‍♂️ 15</li>
<li>🏃‍♂️ Farm road seven</li>

<p>Working with the measurements in Swift is pretty nice but it makes for a lot of code. I've refactored this stuff so many times, at this point I don't care and would rather just get something working.</p>
<ul>
<li>🚶‍♂️ Walk with Nate</li>
<li>☕️ Peet's</li>
<li>📺 The Soul of America</li>

<li>🏃‍♂️ UC Davis six</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed an issue with Steady not publishing state updates. I had overridden the equality operator and Combine wasn't detecting a difference. Seemed silly but I suspect that could come in handy when you wanna exercise control over when an object has meaningfully changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕️ Pachamama's</li>
<li>🎲 RPG with Nate's brothers</li>

<p>Had a quiet Christmas morning with Nate, her mom and brother out on the patio. Ate too many leftovers and finished unwrapping presents right when the rain started.</p>
<ul>
<li>🥡 Chinese takeout</li>
<li>📺 Wonder Woman</li>
<li>📺 Wonder Woman 1984</li>

<p>Listened to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-12-kevin-kelly-of-wired-and-so-much-more/id1476321460?i=1000502012762">this</a> Kevin Kelly interview and pulled some quotes:</p>
<p>> Anonymity is like a rare earth metal that's essential but only in very small doses.</p>
<p>Anonymity is complicated but I think I agree. 4chan style anonymity doesn't seem productive but fostering an identity divorced from your real-world representation is very powerful.</p>
<p>> One of the reasons why China has a Great Wall on censorship is — this is what they say and it's true — to censor out fake news and rumor which is very rampant in China&mldr; They also censor political stuff but that's the proximate reason is to control the incredible rumors and destructive misinformation that was going through social media in China.</p>
<p>A rare cogent defense of the Great Firewall that I had not heard. I would like to learn more 🤔</p>
<p>> The bane of the old media world was propaganda, the bane of the new media world is conspiracy.</p>
<p>Conspiracies are so intoxicating.</p>
