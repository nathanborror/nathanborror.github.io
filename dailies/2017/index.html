<p>8AM - Cloudy park run. Taking 6 to Sightglass on Divis to work, reading Bell Jar.</p>
<p>12PM - Progress on work stuff. Got some lunch from BiRite, taking the 7 home to eat and work.</p>
<p>1PM - Watching talk @Aaron found on Differential Synchronization. This diagram is intense but I think I understand.</p>
<p>3PM - Mom technical support. Apple should be paying me.</p>

<p>🌬🏃 Chilly run through the Park this morning. Made espresso at home before talking with my mom about her phone problems. Apple’s phones become pretty useless after two years which is disappointing.</p>
<p>🚎 Heading into work to finish a migration tool for Relay.<br>
☕️ Sightglass hang reading about diffing algorithms when I should be at the office.<br>
🐣 Migration mostly works. Need to figure out an easy way to generate indexes, hopefully something that works beyond this migration effort.<br>
🥗 Late lunch at Salumeria<br>
📻 🚎 Listening to The Thomas Jefferson Hour on the ride home. Perfume should be illegal.</p>

<h3 id=sunday-december-17-2017>Sunday, December 17, 2017</h3>
<p>Woke up around 8AM and walked to Ritual. Got a little work done before Sunday crowd intensified.</p>
<p>Ran five mile to Ocean Beach. Tide was out so the ocean felt distant. Lots of surfers bobbing.</p>
<p>Got another espresso at Trouble and hung out next to the street before hopping on the N.</p>
<p>Plowing through Annie Leibovitz’s Master Class. These are more like Errol Morris interviews without the Philip Glass existential dread. Glad I bought the year pass.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id=saturday-december-16-2017>Saturday, December 16, 2017</h3>
<p>Woke up and tried out some new Columbian beans from Four Barrel. Messed around with some Go SQL mocking libraries.</p>
<p>Taking the 6 downtown to do another Detour. This one’s based on Gary Kamiya’s book, <a href=https://www.detour.com/san-francisco/cool-gray-city>Cool Gray City of Love</a>.</p>
<p>🥪 Molinari’s<br>
🍸 Comstock</p>

<p>Woke up, went for a 4 mile run through Golden Gate Park. Working on Precap today. Grabbing drinks at 6:30 with a bunch of Designers at Rusted Mule. Might stand in line at Mensho after.</p>
<p>Mensho is AMAZING!!! Rusted Mule is okay. Need to try Rye and Resolute nearby.</p>
<p>The Lyft driver initiated fist-bump 🤜🤛 is the greatest thing after a night out.</p>
