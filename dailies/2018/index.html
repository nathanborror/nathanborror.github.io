<p>Weekend alone begins at Flywheel. Ran into Justin Stahl whom I hadn’t seen in years ☕️💻</p>
<p>Playing around with data portability. I’ve given up trying to use iCloud Drive, it works but introduces a host of concerns I don’t want to deal with for these little tools. Instead I’m making it easy to import / export data. Fun side effect is it makes peer-to-peer sharing really easy.</p>
<p>It’s a shame you can’t post files on Facebook or Twitter. Seems like an odd limitation. Dropbox has no doubt benefited from this.</p>
<p>Interval is packed to the gills with laptops today ☕️</p>
<p>Watchin some hoops with some Kansans 🏀</p>

<h3 id=wednesday-march-28-2018>Wednesday, March 28, 2018</h3>
<p>Ran this morning, felt like a slog but I got through it. Sat for 15. Worked in a very calm Sightglass on Divis until the Yoga wives took over. 🏃🧘‍♂️☕️</p>
<p>Spent most of the day trying to improve my understanding of file management. I’ve worked with some of these APIs but never felt like I had a complete picture of what was going on. The File Coordinator and File Presenter stuff is interesting but watching some of the talks and reading documentation makes me worry this is Apple’s B team. 💻</p>
<p>Spending time with Jess before she goes to Taipei 🇹🇼</p>
<p>Watching Roseanne, feels like a time-warp, oddly just as relatable now as it was twenty years ago. 📺</p>

<p>☕️ Linea Cafe reading an <a href=http://www.e-flux.com/architecture/superhumanity/66967/self-design-or-productive-narcissism/>essay</a> by Boris Groys about the rise of "self-design" in response to the secularization of society. He argues people once behaved to please God rather than society itself, "where religion once was, design emerged." Then he takes a weird transhumanism / fate of the solar system turn.</p>
<p>💻 Improving our logging around push notifications and adding some cleanup methods to discard bad tokens. Development tokens now use the correct APNS endpoint. Also shaved 30 seconds off our build time by building our analytics dashboard and API server in parallel 🤠</p>

<p>Stories shouldn’t appear as unread in the UI when white-space changes occur. Added some documentation around how our more complicated State methods work so future explorers will spend less time understanding what’s going on. Fixed some other small things in the UI.</p>

<p>Playing around with color themes this afternoon. I think we’re gonna want to subtly change the chrome on the main screen to play nicely with each theme. Having a slight gradient is kinda nice as it makes the text a little more readable towards the top.</p>

<h3 id=sunday-march-11-2018>Sunday, March 11, 2018</h3>
<p>☕️ Sightglass on Divis reading Pinker and resurrecting my little note to self app.</p>
<p>🚶‍♂️ Walked home thinking how crazy good nature is at message passing. We’re basically just a bunch of decoders/encoders.</p>
<p>🚶‍♂️ Long walk through GG Park catching up with my mom over the phone. I wanted her to try Instagram so she would see my photos but she was so against it because she didn’t want to share stuff. Got me thinking about designing for consumers, making them feel comfortable just consuming and alleviating the pressure to share.</p>
<p>🎙 Listening to the TED Radio Hour — apparently we’re not so good at <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/591870448/decoding-our-emotions?showDate=2018-03-09">decoding emotions</a>.

<p>Started working on this new transition stuff then got sidetracked reading more about UIPresentationController. Popover Presentation Controller is pretty nice, didn't realize it worked on iPhone.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A pretty good <a href=https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/swifty-presenters/>overview</a> of primarily using a subclass of a PC to achieve a custom transition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WWDC 2017 talk on <a href=https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/230/>advanced animations</a> was also pretty good. He kind of skirts the issue of being a transitioning delegate in his demo.</p>

</ul>
<p>Learned more about property animators and how they don’t work well with the current presentation controller API. The best solution to animate a dimming view alongside a view transition is to thread the animator down to the presentation controller and add an animation block. Works but feels broken, I’m hoping they’ll address this at WWDC.</p>
<p>Also got scroll views working alongside the pan gesture that powers the transition.</p>
<p>Nice thing about all this is I’m left with a nice separation of concerns: 1) a Transitioning Delegate managing the ceremony of adhering to all the protocols and delegates which is largely reusable and 2) a Transition Driver where the animations and gestures are take place.</p>
