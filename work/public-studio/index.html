<h3 id=relay>Relay</h3>
<p>Relay was an attempt to build a modern version of the communities we experienced during the early days of the internet. We took inspiration from IRC, Usenet and forums to build something where people could share comfortably among people with similar interests. The experience was meant to look familiar if you were already comfortable using your phone&rsquo;s native browser. You could search and browse rooms of all types or swipe between them effortlessly.</p>
<p>Admins in the room could control who had &ldquo;voice&rdquo; privileges as well as control over who could execute custom commands in the room. We wanted to make rooms feel programmable so they could be constructed in creative new ways 🎨 Custom keyboards and our API would make this possible.</p>

<h3 id=precap>Precap</h3>
<p>Precap was a daily journaling experience with close friends. Everyone writes about their plans or experiences throughout the day. Close friends can see each other&rsquo;s days and send messages to each other until the next day when everything resets. History is private unless you had a conversation with someone else about a specific day.</p>
