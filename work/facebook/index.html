<p>Facebook was my first job at (what was still considered at the time) a startup. Before joining I was trying to quickly upgrade rural newspapers across the country to a more hopeful future from a basement in Kansas. Moving to Palo Alto was a completely new experience.</p>
<p>There were a total of 20 product designers the day I started which seemed like a lot considering I had come from a much smaller team. The first year was a whirlwind, I was tasked with redesigning the mobile sharing experience, adding structured ways for people to say who they were with and where they were (tagging). As Google+ was rolling out I took on more work to help shore up differences with what we considered a serious competitor. Facebook had a 5000 friends limit which penalized public figures so we added <a href=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2011/09/introducing-the-subscribe-button/>Subscribe</a>, a way for people to follow the public posts of people they admired (it was later renamed to Follow).</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2011 I was encouraged to join a small team of designers working on a new OS for a Facebook branded phone. I spent most of my time re-imagining the communication layer which included chat, voice and relationship management tools. This eventually led me to joining a growing team of folks working on a new standalone app called Messenger. While there I helped ship easier ways for people to privately share more kinds of content, see who was active in the app and take over the primary SMS client on Android.</p>
<p>Throughout most of 2012 I had been learning Objective-C in the mornings, to maintain my motivation I started cloning Snapchat. Snapchat at the time was so difficult to use yet so simple to clone ‚Äî a perfect starter project. I had been sharing progress with other designers and word got around which lead to a mad rush in December to see how quickly we could ship something. Days before Apple&rsquo;s App Store was schedule to close for the holidays we were able to ship a product similar to Snapchat but with disappearing video, text and pokes! We called it <a href=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2012/12/introducing-poke-for-mobile/>Poke</a> because in many ways it kind of related to fun (and sometimes awkward) feature in Facebook that had been around since its inception.</p>
<p>After the Poke experience the company started to invest more in stand-alone apps, creating an effort called Facebook Creative Labs which spawned a lot of exciting ways for people to interact and share. I got involved in something called Shots and helped come up with the idea Moments.</p>
<p>During my final year I became the Product Design Manager for the Photos team where we grew the team and took on more responsibilities. I noticed myself becoming more distant from the work I loved so I decided to leave and see what was happening outside of the first &ldquo;startup&rdquo; I had ever worked for.</p>
