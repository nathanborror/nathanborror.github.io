<p>I&rsquo;d like to introduce a new project of mine. It&rsquo;s called Jupiter. Jupiter is a
project management solution that began August 1, 2004 after heavy research.
Roughly two months of ironing out the database scheme and functionality I&rsquo;m
ready to get feedback and suggestions. Keep in mind things are in the beginning
stages and this is by no means a finished/polished product.</p>
<p>I was planning to provide a run down of all the bells and whistles but I think I
would rather get everyones first impressions and go from there. So here we go:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://jupiter.playgroundblues.com>jupiter.playgroundblues.com</a></li>
<li>Login: demo</li>
<li>Password: demo</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to add projects, notes, milestones, tasks or files. Mess around with
it as much as you can. Let me know what you love, hate, or wish existed.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 10-7-2004:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be releasing 0.10b within the next week. Usability
tweaks and a smoother interface. Thanks everyone for your comments and
suggestions. Stay tuned.</p>
