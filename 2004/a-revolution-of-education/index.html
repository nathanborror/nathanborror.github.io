<p>I believe it&rsquo;s time for a Education Revolution. While I may not be an expert in
learning science I did participate in the Education system for 17 years and
continue to work for an University.</p>
<p>Currently a majority of institutions force students to subscribe to General
Education pressuring them to learn History, Physical Education, Mathematics and
so on. While these topics carry an extreme importance this method of delivery is
wrong. Students shouldn&rsquo;t be pressured into learning anything. During my
freshman year in college I despised going to my Physical Education class because
it was so boring and a waste of my time and effort. However, I now realize the
positive affects exercise can have in my life and work. This is where the
problem lies. That course should have excited me about the affects that physical
activity can bring to my desired goals in life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Students learn best when motivated, when they care. They need to be
emotionally involved, to be drawn to the excitement of the topic. Learning<br>
need not be a dull or dreary exercise, not even learning about what are
normally considered dull and dreary topics: every topic can be made exciting,
every topic excites the emotions of someone, so why not excite everyone?
&ndash; Donald Norman, Emotional Design</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if we broke down the barriers of Education. Instead of offering courses we
enrolled in what I&rsquo;ll call Communities. Each Community would have a focus: Art,
Science, Mathematics; within each community Groups, with related focuses, would
form. For example the Art Community would have a Group which focuses on Design
or Pottery. The students of these communities would not organize in classrooms
nor would they participate in courses. Each Community would reside in its very
own research library. I use the term library loosely because the environment
would need to cater to a wide variety of situations: discussion, research,
building, brainstorming, and so on. Each student would draft goals for
themselves, for the Group, and for the Community. Within the Communities
professors would apply general education discussions based on the goals of the
Community. Students need to learn History so the Communities promote learning
about the Middle Ages and how it relates to the students individual goals, there
by validating its importance to the overall purpose of the Community. Students
would then begin to realize how imperative it is to understand not just one
subject, but all subjects in relation to their goals thereby creating a well
rounded diverse society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is time for lessons to become alive, for history to be seen as a human
struggle, for students to understand and appreciate the structure of art,
music, science, and mathematics. How can these topics be made exciting? By
making them relevant to the lives of each individual student.
&ndash; Donald Norman, Emotional Design</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Education is the cornerstone of society. Without Education society breaks down.
As we grow and mature throughout our life we should never cease to learn. Our
Education institutions must promote life long learning rather than handing out
diplomas and saying next. While this idea may or may not succeed I feel it&rsquo;s
important to continually evolve our methods of teaching and learning in order to
evolve as a society. With that in mind I invite your thoughts and criticism.</p>
