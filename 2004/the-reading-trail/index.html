<p>I&rsquo;ll be finishing up the Da Vinci Code tonight. Once thats over I&rsquo;m going to get
back on the learning train. Cutting back on entertainment television, movies and
other distractions. Time to get down to business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to sharpen my skills as an Information Architect. I&rsquo;ve always
enjoyed the organization of large amounts of data and felt like I was pretty
good at it. However, I feel there is much more to learn.</p>
<p>My first selection will be a classic, The Visual Display of Quantitative
Information by Edward R. Tufte. Scientific American describes it as, &ldquo;original,
beautifully presented, sharp and learned, this book is a work of art. The art
here is cognitive art, the graphic display of relations and empirical data, now
an indispensable tool of science and engineering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to post a review when I&rsquo;m finished.</p>
