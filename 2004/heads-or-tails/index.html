<p>I&rsquo;ve been somewhat silent lately with a few whispers here and there. The past
couple weeks have been very interesting, stressful to say the least. Job, home
and personal changes.</p>
<p>After much thought and pondering I accepted a position at Southwest Missouri
State University as Multimedia Producer. I bid a humble farewell to <a href=http://www.neubix.com/>Neubix
Studios</a>. The gamut of knowledge and wisdom <a href=http://www.justwatchthesky.com/>Ryan</a> and I provided each other was priceless. I&rsquo;m
grateful to have been apart of their transformation and growth. For now I&rsquo;ll be
overseeing the production of interactive and film projects, as well as
advocating standards support and adoption of Open technologies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also moved to a very old apartment next to a very busy street. Outside my
window rests an Art supplies store and many restaurants. I can walk to work,
grocery store, and downtown which makes me oh so happy. Pictures are on the way.</p>
<p>On a personal level I&rsquo;m looking forward to creating more Fine Art. The past year
hasn&rsquo;t provided much time for this, my goal is to pursue painting and mixed
media. I&rsquo;ll also be brushing up on my programming skills to satisfy the left
side of my brain.</p>
<p>As with every coin there is a flip side that I unfortunately can&rsquo;t reveal at
this time. Stay tuned for more articles and updates.</p>
