<p>About a year ago a friend of mine introduced me to a little world called <a href=http://www.rilokiley.com>Rilo
Kiley</a>. Her two albums, &ldquo;Execution of All Things&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Takeoffs and Landings&rdquo;, bring sunshine to a rainy day and lift you up to a
place not often visited through music. Jenny Lewis&rsquo;s voice never seems to grow
old. They&rsquo;re songs are so diverse and colorful.</p>
<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t believe they could top their last two releases. &ldquo;More
Adventurous&rdquo; proves me wrong and lives up to its name. The only way to describe
it is if you took a petal from each of your favorite flowers and pasted them all
together creating a colleague of fragrance. You can hear a little bit of the
past, present and get a gimps of the future. This band has a lot of potential
and definitely worth experiencing.</p>
