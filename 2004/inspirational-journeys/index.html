<p>In 1947 sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski, moved too Thunder Mountain. He constructed a 741 foot staircase to the peak of the Mountain to begin, with his lone jackhammer, possibly the worlds largest sculpture, <a href=http://www.crazyhorse.org/carving/face/index.shtml>Crazy Horse</a>. For the next 33 years he chipped away at the mammoth mountain side until his death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His eye is 12 feet wide, his outstretched arm the length of a subway train. And by the time his horse is finished, we&rsquo;ll all be dead. Ready Made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recent issue of <a href=http://readymademag.com/currentissue.php>Ready Made</a> has its top inspirational ESCape&rsquo;s. They include: <a href=http://www.crazyhorse.org/>Crazy Horse Memorial</a>, <a href=http://www.pricetower.org>Price Tower</a>,
<a href=http://www.roadtripamerica.com/places/forest.htm>Underground Gardens</a>, <a href=http://www.chinati.org>Marfa</a>, <a href=http://www.bestfriends.org>Animal Sanctuary</a>, and <a href=http://www.monks.org>Gethesmani</a>. I&rsquo;m seriously thinking about spending a couple nights in &ldquo;the tree that escaped the crowded forest,&rdquo; then hopping over too &ldquo;The mounted man of South Dakota,&rdquo; and finishing the trip off with a visit too &ldquo;A solitary man&rsquo;s subterranean legacy.&rdquo; This is definitely an issue worth checking out.</p>
