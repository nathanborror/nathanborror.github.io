<p>This is my last week at my current employer, <a href=http://www.lookandfeel.com>Look and Feel</a> which would explain my lack of good posts. I can&rsquo;t
express how fortunate I am to have spent time with the fine lads of LaF. I will
miss them dearly, although, I&rsquo;ll still be living in the neighborhood so I&rsquo;m sure
our paths will cross.</p>
<p>My near future rests at a place called <a href=http://www.brmethod.com>Method</a> within
<a href=http://www.bernstein-rein.com>Bernstein-Rein</a>. A fortune teller has forcasted
very long hours but many laughs and Belgium beer flowing from the hill tops. Ok,
maybe not the last one so much. I&rsquo;ll be #7 of an extremely talented group
scrambling to keep up.</p>
