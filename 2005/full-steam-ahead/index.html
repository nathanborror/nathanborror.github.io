<p>Playground Blues is officially on <a href=http://www.rubyonrails.com>Rails</a>.
Approximately <a href=http://playgroundblues.com/archive/bejeweled>two weeks</a> ago I
started chugging along and with this new language. Surprisingly it&rsquo;s been quite
welcoming and easy to learn. I only wish it were just as easy to ween clients
over to this oasis.</p>
<p>Along with the change of language came some other needed changes. One of them
being my move from Textile to <a href=http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>Markdown</a>
otherwise known as <a href=http://www.deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth>BlueCloth</a> in
Rails. Markdown just seemed more natural to the way I type. Another change
included a new Flash Photoblog that is built using an <a href=http://www.actionscript.org/tutorials/intermediate/Flash_Broadcasters_and_Listeners/index.shtml>asynchronous event model</a>
philosophy. I&rsquo;ve been trying to wrap my mind around this more and I think I&rsquo;m
beginning to understand its major benefits.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. This is an exciting endeavor and I&rsquo;ve got a lot more tricks up my
sleeve.</p>
