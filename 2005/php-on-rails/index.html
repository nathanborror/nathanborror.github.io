<p><a href=http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>Ruby</a> buzz has been making its rounds these last
few months. I&rsquo;m anxious to use <a href=http://www.rubyonrails.com>Rails</a> but my ISP
nor my employer support it. So I&rsquo;ve been stuck staring at the colorful lollypop
from a distance.</p>
<p><a href=http://www.cakephp.com/>Cake</a> may be the solution to my problems, at least
until Ruby becomes more widely supported. Cake is a PHP framework based on the
Rails design. It&rsquo;s still in its infancy but it looks pretty solid. The developer
has shown his commitment by releasing four updates in a row this month.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> As of April 18th Cake has been updated to <a href=https://trac.cakephp.org/wiki/Cake/Download>0.2.7</a> with some nice new enhancements.
There is now a code generator, however, it only works in Windows. This update
also includes Flay (Textile like formating class), form generators, Folder
class, and the beginnings of data validation with the Model using regular
expressions.</p>
