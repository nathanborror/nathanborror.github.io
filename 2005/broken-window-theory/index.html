<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve become a little obsessed with the &ldquo;Broken Window Theory.&rdquo; I was
introduced to this theory by <a href=http://www.squidfingers.com>Travis</a> and <a href=http://www.alwayscurious.com>Charlie</a>. Soon after, it began popping into my head at
work, home, or while I was coding. Then I started noticing it in <a href=http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/>books</a> and on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4520866">radio</a>.</p>
<p>The theory is normally applied to urban decay and crime, however, it can be
applied to almost anything. How did your apartment get so dirty? How did your
code get out of control? Well, it&rsquo;s all because of one sock, one poorly placed
if statement, or one broken window.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills
a sense of abandonment â€” a sense that the powers that be don&rsquo;t care. So another
window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural
damage begins. In a relativly short space of time, the structure becomes damaged
beyond the desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The preceding quote was taken from <a href=http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/>The Pragmatic Programmer</a> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. It
basically means watch out for the small stuff. If you can keep the tiny cracks
out early they won&rsquo;t turn into gorges. The hope is that if your projects are
pristine and another person is invited to change or update something they will
take notice in its perfection and not want to be the first to break a window.</p>
