<p>Since the release of Tiger and particularly Quicktime 7 sporting the new H.264
codec I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if we&rsquo;re glimpsing a bigger picture here. If you
haven&rsquo;t checked out the unbelievable quality of H.264 go over to the <a href=http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/>HD Gallery</a> and witness the days of pixilation
disappear.</p>
<p>With this brings some interesting thoughts; does Apple have a roadmap for video
on demand? Well, they&rsquo;ve already started doing it with iTunes 4.8. We now have
the choice to buy music videos and video extras that would normally be found on
CD&rsquo;s. This however doesn&rsquo;t seem to be using the H.264 codec at the moment but
I&rsquo;m sure it will follow. Will the iPod soon have video functionality to echo
iTunes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People love listening to music as a background activity when they&rsquo;re
exercising, when they&rsquo;re commuting and when they&rsquo;re just hanging out. Music is
a wonderful thing because A, it&rsquo;s music, and B, because it can be listened to
as a background activity. And a lot of these other things that people are
talking about building in, such as video and things like that, are foreground
activities.
&ndash; Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears the iPod is slowly creeping into our foreground. Right behind it
could be a video-on-demand Mac Mini. I only hope they choose to offer not-so
mainstream content like Independent Films and Documentaries that you wouldn&rsquo;t
normally find on television. Could this also pave the way for a new bread of
video podcasts? Vidcasts?</p>
