<p>Why would anybody want to pre-order an album off of iTunes? The whole idea of
the &ldquo;pre-order&rdquo; is that your John Hancock gets placed on a list of elite few who
get first dibs on a product before it sells out. It is virtually impossible for
iTunes to sell out of a song, which makes me wonder what yahoo in the war room
decided it&rsquo;d be cool to have &ldquo;pre-orders&rdquo; in iTunes. Downloadable music is
branded as instant satisfaction which makes this confusing.</p>
<p>I understand it sort of serves as a teaser but this is the web and thats just a
lame use of it. Offer me an exclusive song and tell me it&rsquo;ll be followed up by
an album (which they already do and seems to work). I pray for the server
administrators that sweat their bandwidth skyrocket when the clock strikes
twelve and um-teen-thousand albums are automatically dispersed. (End of rant)</p>
