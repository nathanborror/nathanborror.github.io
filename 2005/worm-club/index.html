<p>Friends and cohorts keep asking me me to recommend books so in an effort to
slightly curb this I&rsquo;ve manifested the list below. Warning: I cannot guarantee
I&rsquo;ve finished these books. I have a tendency, possibly fear, of finishing books.
I literally get to the last chapter and it sits on my coffee table for weeks.
So far, these have been intriguing books to me:</p>
<p><strong>Blink and The Tipping Point</strong> by Malcom Gladwell. I group these two together
because they go hand in hand. Blink is about snap judgement. It takes a very
micro approach on how we make decisions in the blink of an eye. Tipping Point
slaps on a macro lens and dives into how we as a society come to fall in love
with products. Both are fascinating and suited well for anyone interested in the
human psyche.</p>
<p><strong>A Whole New Mind</strong> by Daniel Pink. The Information Age is nearing it&rsquo;s slow
death and we&rsquo;re beginning to witness the rise of the Conceptual Age. Think twice
about getting that MBA. With the outsourcing of &ldquo;information jobs&rdquo; to Asia you
may want to investigate the fruits of the MFA. This book is a portal to many
resources and it&rsquo;s been keeping me very busy.</p>
<p><strong>Voices of a People&rsquo;s History of the United States</strong> by Howard Zinn. How did I
end up believing Christopher Columbus was a &ldquo;great man&rdquo; and worthy of his own
day. This was a man that &ldquo;kidnapped, maimed and killed the indigenous people of
Hispanola in pursuit of gold.&rdquo; This book sheds much needed light on those who in
the face of opposition and hardship spoke out. This undeniable view of history
is shocking and raw.</p>
<p>Graphic Designers Guide to Clients by Ellen Shapiro. I used to be very defensive
around clients. Mainly because I lacked the ability to put myself in their
shoes. Shapiro provides numerous real world examples of successful client
relationships.</p>
<p>Story, Substance, Structure, Style, and The Principles of Screenwriting by
Robert McKee. Why should a web designer care about story? It happens to be the
vehicle to our minds. A good story can elicit any number of emotions. Emotions
are products of the right side of our brain which is the gateway to the left.
In advertising or design we must be in tune with this so our message effectively
captivates its audience. McKee intricately dissects the building blocks of good
story.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will wet your appetite. Any number of these will make you think
differently after setting them down. I&rsquo;ve been permanently altered by all of
them.</p>
