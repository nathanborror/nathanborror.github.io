<p>Today I posted a public photo of how nicely done a bank start-up&rsquo;s packaging was and didn&rsquo;t realize my card number was in plain view. Now, I&rsquo;m a pretty rational individual so I did what everyone else would have done which is call the customer service number on the back of the card. Apparently they have Sundays off so I had to leave two anxious messages on their answering machine.</p>
<p>They promptly called and I was so agitated I messed up my birthdate during the identity verification process. Upon explaining what happened the support person said I wasn&rsquo;t the first, which didn&rsquo;t surprise me due to the very photogenic packaging.</p>
<p>When I first opened it I thought, &ldquo;wow they&rsquo;re serious, I bet a lot of people are posting photos of this which could be a great awareness strategy.&rdquo; The packaging is square, which stands out among other mail, laser etched high quality cardboard with a big blue rubber band holding a clean white bank card. Move the rubber band just a half centimeter south and the card number would be completely covered, avoiding this whole situation. If this isn&rsquo;t a great case for Defensive Design&mldr;</p>
<p>This got me thinking about start-ups moving into established territory like banking. <a href=https://twitter.com/nathanborror/status/225268922176380929>I mentioned last week,</a> the scariest thing about [bank start-up] is giving them money — not because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll lose it, they are backed by the FDIC, but because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve experienced what established banks have. Customer service is quite possibly their only hope, which underlines how crucial around the clock support is. If that brave Sunday afternoon support guy hadn&rsquo;t called when he did I probably would have given up on them come Monday.</p>

<li>Except when I&rsquo;m hungry. You should have seen this post before lunch.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s worth noting I still haven&rsquo;t deposited any money into this account, therefore my panic may have been a little preemptive (possibly due to hunger). However, anytime I see the word Visa on a plastic card with my name on it I assume charges can be made.</li>
